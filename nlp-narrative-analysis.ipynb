I know that as a writer it's not so much about using fewer words, but having fewer words per line. The brain can easily skim read a line that only has a few spaced words, making the whole text snippet easily readable at a glance. I'll try to demonstrate: This paragraph is easily read, because your brain's more efficient at handling fewer words per Line. Especially when spaced. This paragraph is not quite as easily read, becaus your brain finds it harder to read longer passages of text per line. Spacing's more apparent too. Language should always be clear and concise, but clear and concise lanugage can still feel bulky with bad formating and strain your players\",\"I died when I saw they used Tony G's quote at the beginning lol\",\"Best vid ever and it looks so coool😀😀😀 it cheered me up\",\"#4 is definitely one of the biggest criticisms I see of Yugioh right now. Although they are long, the effects can be complex, and have a lot of specific limitations on when and how often they can be used. The latter is really what half of the text is. Terms and conditions. Additionally, in Asian language prints, they list out and give each effect a card has by a number, and reference each numbered effect whenever necessary. Also, makes it easy to know where one effect ends, and the other begins. All other languages, you have to read through a block of text, and deduce logically where each one ends, and each one begins. The Asian region is run and overseen by a different branch of Konami compared to the one in the West. So that is likely one reason why this format hasn't been moved over. One thing I actually would like to see get implemented. And keywords discourse I've found to be pretty touchy subject too within the community. Some players seem to loathe the idea because everything isn't spelled out directly to them, and increases the number of things new players need to learn, or something to those lines. When the game alreaady technically has 2 keywords that exist (Excavate and piercing). Adding in a few more to very specific actions that cannot have variations wouldn't be the end of the world. Although keywords in Yugioh in general is hard, since you can have like 6 different variations of a similar thing. Like in MTG, you have hexproof. It does one thing. While in Yugioh, you have cards that have similar abilities, but sometimes only for specific kinds of cards (Like only from Spells or only from monsters). You also have cards that are kind of reverse (Unaffected by anything that doesn't target it). At that point, it is probably easier to just be explicit with it at the cost of some real estate.\",\"They turned the Uno game into a action film\",\"Ikr\",\"@@SirCitrus_VRreal\",\"fr\",\"Bro drink jus\",\"@@DarrianYates young girl a slowed and reverbed\",\"how do you edit like this holt shit this is amazing\",\"Wqowk😢tramarine-j1f\",\"It was to hard beat him\",\"@@muhammadrizqullah1539❤❤❤❤\",\"The best edit I seen today\",\"​​@@antwigreaves3809wsg bro...literally\",\"I love this edit 😊😊😊😊\",\"​@@adrianphillips8862 same bro 😂😂\",\"@@Duke_The_Bandit suit yourself.

If I saw the cost in that position instead, it's certainly the most useful info I could know about the card while it hasn't yet been played, but (ignoring any other potential visual indicators for the sake of this example like seeing part of the art) I might not necessarily know *what* card it might be of that cost, for all I know the deck might be stacked with other cards that also cost two blue mana. however this only applies once you have played a game enough to tell what any card does just by the name or the art, this doesn't apply to new players which you should be probably be formatting the card's interface in service of.

I think with a CCG the large potential card pool makes it make sense to have some priority on being able to pronounce text easily while that might not be necessary in the scope of a single board game.

If you play anything from Fantasy Flight games, like Arkham Horror, or Marvel Champions, on the bottom of the card they'll often have a set symbol and then a number. Like a skull then a 148. If you can't use the symbol (like asking on a text only forum or something) translating the set is far easier than translating the card name. A card named \\\"black knight\\\" in another language may not actually be called the equivalent in English (usually because a name may have unwanted connotations, like if a word or phrase could be considered rude in one language but not another). In this way you could instead ask \\\"what is the purpose of card 158 in the latest set\\\" rather than trying to find out what the cards english name is.\",\"​@@HattaSoeratta But when Jiren did it in the ToP arc, he tanked it like it was nothing.

You bring up a great point, the key is readability and to a lesser extent theme. When everything works well together the game is awesome. I referenced magic quite a bit because most people are familiar with it, but it was also designed many years ago so use that how you will. I also 100% agree that having to go into the rulebook for every keyword or the FAQ ruins most games.\",\"Man they better be quiet because they workin on vinland saga season 3 while they bullshittin\",\"What's the music for this\",\"text\",\"​@@SummoButBetter70th like\",\"The edit is so impressive\",\"text\",\"Dom​ain Expansion Baka Uno Out!\",\"so true\",\"Dont forget the plankton drinking part\",\"TRUE\",\"Your first mistake was putting down your +2 first\",\"@@that_1_man18exactly😂\",\"@@SummoButBetterthe song is paranoia\",\"@@nuclearhazard1-1 Thanks I will search it up\",\"@@gaijinco Heyy, sorry my message wasn't clear at all.

The majority of people that play card games are card game players. Familiarity helps players understand new games faster. My whole point is magics cost in the top right or yugiohs attribute\\u002flevel in the top right isn't a cut and dry bad design. There are pros and cons.

To get around this they have a sub-rule: if you have space to explain the thing, explain the thing. This most commonly occurs with set-specific keywords like Soulbond. What does Soulbond do? Well I can look at my Wingcrafter (which is a common card) and everything I need to know about the keyword is right there. Now when I get a rare or mythic card that JUST has the keyword I already know what it does. So one variation of your card could read: Gain one colourless power shard (colourless power shard symbol).

And yes, I'm right handed. So anyway in conclusion idk if that rule which you said is actually true or not, honestly. I mean the rule sure but he using left vs right not that sure. Maybe I do it like that because in the card games I played the most (Yugioh and MTG) it's better to fan the cards like that? I legit have no clue I just know that it feels natural to do it this way and unnatural the other way and that makes me wonder if it's really true that mana values should be in left and not right... I mean in the kind of cards I want to make that doesn't really matters and I guess it's still better to use the top left if possible since we read left-right and top-down but yeah quite weird.\",\"Iconography is nice until you need to read the text out, or tell the other players what the text means.

Including it shouldn't make any legal difference. Denmark is like The Netherlands at the very top when it comes to English as a second language. This is largely due to tv with subtitles and of course the high use of internet. Tv doesn't get duped here except for some kids shows\\u002fmovies and the frankly horrible series shown on Disney-channel. You can easily show English youtube to pupils without much issues. It is something I've done a lot when teaching science, mostly to age 10-13. I agree that it is weird why the Netherlands doesn't just use the English version of games, instead of bothering with translation. I guess it's mostly because of nationalism, pride and tradition :). The Netherlands has triple the population compared to Denmark, so it is also a larger marked, but still relatively small. I personally would love the idea of Danish being slowly out phased, but English isn't a particular good language in its current form, being a mix of multiple languages explains the horrible connection between spelling and pronunciation of words. I agree that games can be simplified, but I think games like \\\"Monopoly\\\" would be a hard sell. You would remove a lot of the fun by changing the names to merely colours. The game is called Matador in Denmark and is from 1936. It is a slightly changed version of Monopoly, but has unmistakingly the same core gameplay. It has always used the same street names and is considered nothing less than a cult board game. Part of the fun is owning famous\\u002fhistorical streets, like getting \\\"Rådhuspladesen\\\" (AKA the town square in Copenhagen) it is something very special.

If you study Magic cards, you’ll see that while they use, for example, the tap symbol when saying “tap the card to do this”, if they mention tapping in the rest of the text they say the word “tap”. They only have a few symbols that they routinely use in the actual ability text: those for mana costs, and even then it’s used sparingly. People know how to read words, but they don’t come to your game knowing what your symbols mean in the context of your game. If you send them to the reference manual too many times to figure out what your symbols mean it’ll be frustrating. You can still use your symbols if you think they’d be useful, but reminder text (again, see mtg) is a good idea so that players stay immersed.\",\"this is an underexxageration\",\"movies vs a 20 second clip that took 3 months to make.... right\",\"Grazie mille Antonietta\",\"I don’t like anime, but I’d watch it\",\"@@cauz8129 Nah, I’d fail\",\"😆\",\"​​@@jasperhalsey8574 And I can picture Hellmuth's disgusted face after he said it :-)\",\"I'm like 666 I mean in likes\",\"Imo, the symbols can be duel edged sword.

I'll try to demonstrate: This paragraph is easily read, because your brain's more efficient at handling fewer words per Line. Especially when spaced.

If I saw the cost in that position instead, it's certainly the most useful info I could know about the card while it hasn't yet been played, but (ignoring any other potential visual indicators for the sake of this example like seeing part of the art) I might not necessarily know *what* card it might be of that cost, for all I know the deck might be stacked with other cards that also cost two blue mana. however this only applies once you have played a game enough to tell what any card does just by the name or the art, this doesn't apply to new players which you should be probably be formatting the card's interface in service of.

It keeps the image clear and unobscured by mechanical aspects of the game shown in text or icons. It means that when I'm looking at the art I'm looking at the art unobstructed and able to appreciate it fully, and when I'm looking for mechanical components I can find them where I know they will be without the colors and shapes of the art behind them distracting my eye and changing the color and shape language of the area around the game mechanic icon or text. I also care about my cards, and when a nick at the edge of a card damages a black or yellow, or white border or whatever, I don't care so much, but if it damages the edge of the card art I'm much more invested and bummed out by it. I can appreciate the odd full card art style from time to time, but I never use those cards, with the exception of simple resource cards such as energies in Pokemon or lands in Magic where there isn't really any other icons or text to worry about obscuring and the image is simple enough that it won't matter so much. I know it would make all card games look exactly the same if they have an art frame, and the art is in the upper half of the card, and the name is above that, and maybe that chokes the market a lot by new games looking \\\"samey\\\" at a glance, but if you make your game have art to the edges, and card information on top of the art, it fatigues me mentally over time in a way that's not necessary, and I won't pick up those cards to play as often as I might have if I wasn't fatigued by just looking at them. The golden rule here should be \\\"Treat your art like any other image on your card. You wouldn't layer icons or make text run across them. Don't layer icons or text over images. Art is paramount.\\\" The image is just a bigger icon which is more unique from other icons so it can serve to identify the card at a glance. It should be respected as such. For example, the big green orb your game puts overlapping the base of the card art could have been a green bar that served as a bottom frame with a much smaller circle or diamond part at the middle of the line where your green orb is located. Small enough that it doesn't intrude visually on the image above or the information below, but wide enough as a bar to always be visible no matter where your thumb lands while holding it. Almost the width of the card. I'd actually recommend making this change in your own game's layout in future card sets if it's a persistent game, or later editions if it's a boxed card game. The big colorful circle is fun and whimsical at first glance, but it's also just a massive blank green field on the card that's wasting space and obscuring other elements. If it was white or black you'd see it for the wasted space it is as designed. It kind of feels like I had paint on my thumb when I was playing the game one time and now that smudge won't ever come off. Anyway, I wasn't trying to be too harsh, and I realize this is a lot of criticism in one of 3 comments on a video with 5 golden rules, so I want to end this one saying these observations aren't terrible. We all have our own methods and opinions. Take them or leave them, and don't let yourself dwell on what I've said here for more than it took to read the text unless you feel like you agree with what I said.

Although they are long, the effects can be complex, and have a lot of specific limitations on when and how often they can be used. The latter is really what half of the text is. Terms and conditions. Additionally, in Asian language prints, they list out and give each effect a card has by a number, and reference each numbered effect whenever necessary. Also, makes it easy to know where one effect ends, and the other begins. All other languages, you have to read through a block of text, and deduce logically where each one ends, and each one begins. The Asian region is run and overseen by a different branch of Konami compared to the one in the West. So that is likely one reason why this format hasn't been moved over. One thing I actually would like to see get implemented. And keywords discourse I've found to be pretty touchy subject too within the community. Some players seem to loathe the idea because everything isn't spelled out directly to them, and increases the number of things new players need to learn, or something to those lines. When the game alreaady technically has 2 keywords that exist (Excavate and piercing). Adding in a few more to very specific actions that cannot have variations wouldn't be the end of the world. Although keywords in Yugioh in general is hard, since you can have like 6 different variations of a similar thing. Like in MTG, you have hexproof. It does one thing. While in Yugioh, you have cards that have similar abilities, but sometimes only for specific kinds of cards (Like only from Spells or only from monsters). You also have cards that are kind of reverse (Unaffected by anything that doesn't target it). At that point, it is probably easier to just be explicit with it at the cost of some real estate.\",\"@@SeisoYabai Exactly.

Meanwhile, the card's level, which only regularly came into play as a possible cost for summoning, was illustrated as a row of bright and colorful star orbs laid out under the card's name. Also, the art looked amateur. The colors and frames looked like someone slapped them together in Photoshop in under 10 minutes.

Take for example in MTG: The different mana symbols practically mean the same thing, but they all have designs that make sure you can tell them apart even if they were to be in just black and white (like people with complete colour blindness would see them, for example).

Symbols take a ton of memory space to learn since you have to connect them to words in your head anyway, and I get really turned off reading text with too many of them. I feel like MTG does symbols really well: it has 7 recurring symbols (the 5 mana symbols, the colorless mana symbol, and the tap symbol), but all of these fall into categories (mana and tapping). The mana symbols don't take much memory space to tell them apart from each other because they're all the same size and shape, so really you have two symbols- mana symbols and tapping. 2 symbols is a lot easier to memorize than 5 or more, which is something I see in a lot of games nowadays. The symbols in MTG also don't come up when describing interactions between cards. MTG never uses the tap symbol to tell you that a card taps down an opposing creature, only to tell you to tap a card for an effect.\",\"Never let me play Ono with yall​@kinagcash1194\",\"Anime of UNO\",\"@@AnaIvanovic4evereven the childhood gospels?\",\"Guys what's the name of the song 😅\",\"itll be hard but EPIC!!!!!!\",\"real\",\"Fr fr\",\"Haha, You are right he did!\",\"Ayo 666 coments wth 💀\",\"Bro made a five star meal\",\"😮. .\",\"This animation of the new domain expansion is fire\",\"@@SummoButBetterparanoia\",\"What’s this song\",\"Dkwuwkjwk❤🎉\\u003c♡♡♡♡♡♥︎♡♡♥︎♡♡♡♡♡♡♡\",\"What do you mean by \\\"Melting pot New Orleans\\\"?\",\"@@Dranaki_VR😊\",\"bonooooo\",\"Q​@@kurtmatteson4914\",\"I'm not even sure it's _possible_ to make a better TCG card layout than Magic's.\",\"@@fluffyFaris fr\",\"That FSHHHH, CHH CHHH, HAAAAAA WAS PERFECT\",\"your so right\",\"The solo leveling statue smile meme on the hoodie guy says everything about a brutal, traumatizing and psychological war💀\",\"This guys gonna have to explain to Satan how in the f#ck he died from uno.\",\"girl a @@Éxodo337\",\"🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💤💤💤💤💤💤\",\"Pov: when demon slayer players play uno\",\"@@thelostanimatronic I still don't know, is it something inappropriate?\",\"Yo they should do an uno anime, this guy better be his own main character voicing in it\",\"Saw it on tiktok, and i gotta say i keep going back to watch it over and over\",\"Uhm...UHMMM....... lelo and stitch UHMMM....\",\"​@curiousbear895ojididhdudhdhfhdhrhhdhdhhrhehdhdhdhhdhdhdhdhdhdhdhdh\",\"@@TheUnkGamer wow 0 replies?\",\"Fax!\",\"Grande jack\",\"reallll\",\"Why it is better to have resource costs in the upper left instead of upper right.

Neither keywording nor iconising are good ideas. They may make cards appear more readable at a glance, but when you actually try to read them for the sake of playing the game, keywording and iconising significantly reduce readability by requiring the player to reference the rulebook. There's a reason that MTG so strongly avoids doing either, using reminder text wherever font size allows and never adding a new icon that hasn't been a variation on the mana symbol (except for that one time they did the untap symbol for thematic reasons and then never did it again). Icons are especially bad because they break up the flow of a sentence - to be able to read the card, I have to learn how to pronounce your icons, and in many cases those icons' pronunciations aren't intuitive. \\\"read crossed swords as combat value\\\" is definitely not. The only time you can get away with icons is when the icons represent game objects, or maybe object properties, but that should still be done very sparingly, and it's a lot less likely to work in a card game than it is a board game. Under no circumstances should an action ever be iconed.\",\"that's right\",\"💪💪🧠💪💪💪💪💪🦾🦾🦾🫀🫀🫀🫀🫀🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾👹☠️👺\",\"@@LazarusRiosit’s the animation studios mappa not a toy company\",\"why do their noses look so phallic\",\"Nahh jit I already feel could💀\",\"I always win\",\"Kageguri but Unoguri😂\",\"Tru\",\"Ikr\",\"YOU SIR ARE A GOD\",\"Me too\",\"efectivamente, cine\",\"@@rosdimohd1738 that aged badly LOL\",\"O shit\",\"the average Anime-uno match\",\"lmao, the Tony G quote at the beggining\",\"You all Cleary didn't lose all ur friends in mario party\",\"I come back to this video every once in a while to remind myself what the best short is on youtube\",\"genuinely the best thing on youtube ive ever seen\",\"Fax\",\"​@groovie_demon4788 Damn😂😂😂\",\"spero basti un commento a caso come questo per essere estratti\",\"Domain expansion demonic cards\",\"Grande jackkkk\",\"NAH GET THIS MAN A JOB IN ANIMATION THIS WAS FIRE\",\"Godtier editing\",\"Ich werde mich momberne💀\",\"@@Love_drbellabrothers\",\"Omg\",\"I'm sorry bro, but we're gonna have to give you to Mappa.\",\"@@ZachXFire79not even close to uno as a card game yugi more like pokémon but expanded\",\"I mean there's that gambling Anime so if that is a thing i'm sure uno has potential\",\"W\",\"I joined 4ra’s fantasy league and it’s fantastic! the new ad convinced me to try it.\",\"@@kimiaranda2629lol\",\"YES EXACT SAME REACTION!!!\",\"Yes\",\"True😂😂😂😂\",\"@@سون_كاكاروت unfortunately YouTube is not allowing me to\",\"Man you're the 🐐GOAT\",\"FR\",\"@@bamers404 Me too, people were complaining that there were too many words in the card effects, so they made the text smaller to fit even more effects on each card.

Even if I have an experienced player who can help me, is going to be very embarrassing and confusing to ask \\\"what does the little symbol that kinda looks like a question mark mean?\\\" On the other hand, if symbols *reinforce* an idea, then I 100% agree. In your game, I see the big green green in your card. So when the effect asks if the card below is [green gem], I immediately get what it means, even if \\\"green gem\\\" isn't the right term.

Including it shouldn't make any legal difference. Denmark is like The Netherlands at the very top when it comes to English as a second language. This is largely due to tv with subtitles and of course the high use of internet. Tv doesn't get duped here except for some kids shows\\u002fmovies and the frankly horrible series shown on Disney-channel. You can easily show English youtube to pupils without much issues. It is something I've done a lot when teaching science, mostly to age 10-13. I agree that it is weird why the Netherlands doesn't just use the English version of games, instead of bothering with translation. I guess it's mostly because of nationalism, pride and tradition :). The Netherlands has triple the population compared to Denmark, so it is also a larger marked, but still relatively small. I personally would love the idea of Danish being slowly out phased, but English isn't a particular good language in its current form, being a mix of multiple languages explains the horrible connection between spelling and pronunciation of words. I agree that games can be simplified, but I think games like \\\"Monopoly\\\" would be a hard sell. You would remove a lot of the fun by changing the names to merely colours. The game is called Matador in Denmark and is from 1936. It is a slightly changed version of Monopoly, but has unmistakingly the same core gameplay. It has always used the same street names and is considered nothing less than a cult board game. Part of the fun is owning famous\\u002fhistorical streets, like getting \\\"Rådhuspladesen\\\" (AKA the town square in Copenhagen) it is something very special.

To get around this they have a sub-rule: if you have space to explain the thing, explain the thing. This most commonly occurs with set-specific keywords like Soulbond. What does Soulbond do? Well I can look at my Wingcrafter (which is a common card) and everything I need to know about the keyword is right there. Now when I get a rare or mythic card that JUST has the keyword I already know what it does. So one variation of your card could read: Gain one colourless power shard (colourless power shard symbol).

There's some tradeoffs compared to graphical symbols though; particularly I think graphical symbols stand out more and can stand out even in small spaces, but keywords can be more intuitive to read especially in terms of pronouncing a card out loud (like if trying to describe a card in Magic that has Haste, one just says \\\"it has haste\\\", but if it had some symbol like a person running or similar it might not be obvious how to say it without checking the rules). I think with a CCG the large potential card pool makes it make sense to have some priority on being able to pronounce text easily while that might not be necessary in the scope of a single board game.

If you revisit some of the classic Yu-Gi-Oh cards you may be pleasantly reminded of just how perfect the layout is.\",\"😮😮😮😮😮😮😮?\",\"FR\",\"\\\"Domain Expansion : +16,000 cards\",\"Fr 😂😂\",\"Keep cooking bro\",\"@@youngsam8159 Except that Kakegurui is a batshit crazy, BDSM anime\\u002falmost he*tai.

Every basic land, for example, has a different pice of art for literally ever expansion they've put out in the last 40 years.\",\"11:20 I actually really like card games that have their art in a frame on the card like the big 3 Magic, Pokemon, and Yugioh do. It keeps the image clear and unobscured by mechanical aspects of the game shown in text or icons. It means that when I'm looking at the art I'm looking at the art unobstructed and able to appreciate it fully, and when I'm looking for mechanical components I can find them where I know they will be without the colors and shapes of the art behind them distracting my eye and changing the color and shape language of the area around the game mechanic icon or text. I also care about my cards, and when a nick at the edge of a card damages a black or yellow, or white border or whatever, I don't care so much, but if it damages the edge of the card art I'm much more invested and bummed out by it. I can appreciate the odd full card art style from time to time, but I never use those cards, with the exception of simple resource cards such as energies in Pokemon or lands in Magic where there isn't really any other icons or text to worry about obscuring and the image is simple enough that it won't matter so much. I know it would make all card games look exactly the same if they have an art frame, and the art is in the upper half of the card, and the name is above that, and maybe that chokes the market a lot by new games looking \\\"samey\\\" at a glance, but if you make your game have art to the edges, and card information on top of the art, it fatigues me mentally over time in a way that's not necessary, and I won't pick up those cards to play as often as I might have if I wasn't fatigued by just looking at them. The golden rule here should be \\\"Treat your art like any other image on your card. You wouldn't layer icons or make text run across them. Don't layer icons or text over images. Art is paramount.\\\" The image is just a bigger icon which is more unique from other icons so it can serve to identify the card at a glance. It should be respected as such. For example, the big green orb your game puts overlapping the base of the card art could have been a green bar that served as a bottom frame with a much smaller circle or diamond part at the middle of the line where your green orb is located. Small enough that it doesn't intrude visually on the image above or the information below, but wide enough as a bar to always be visible no matter where your thumb lands while holding it. Almost the width of the card. I'd actually recommend making this change in your own game's layout in future card sets if it's a persistent game, or later editions if it's a boxed card game. The big colorful circle is fun and whimsical at first glance, but it's also just a massive blank green field on the card that's wasting space and obscuring other elements. If it was white or black you'd see it for the wasted space it is as designed. It kind of feels like I had paint on my thumb when I was playing the game one time and now that smudge won't ever come off. Anyway, I wasn't trying to be too harsh, and I realize this is a lot of criticism in one of 3 comments on a video with 5 golden rules, so I want to end this one saying these observations aren't terrible.

If you study Magic cards, you’ll see that while they use, for example, the tap symbol when saying “tap the card to do this”, if they mention tapping in the rest of the text they say the word “tap”. They only have a few symbols that they routinely use in the actual ability text: those for mana costs, and even then it’s used sparingly. People know how to read words, but they don’t come to your game knowing what your symbols mean in the context of your game. If you send them to the reference manual too many times to figure out what your symbols mean it’ll be frustrating. You can still use your symbols if you think they’d be useful, but reminder text (again, see mtg) is a good idea so that players stay immersed.\",\"Ну круто же вышло😊\",\"@@Ambatukam_Bro real\",\"It will become an anime one day, there is an anime about a guy in a gambling school 😂\",\"What about the song?\",\"Le medallion le ha veramente buttate 🤦🏻‍♂️\",\"Domain expansion: Self embodiment of uno\",\"Gfjgyjjjjjjgyg😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂😂😅\",\"@@Dranaki_VR Can you look up Mercy?\",\"bRO THAT ALWAYS HAPENNS TO ME LIKE I SAY ''UNO'' MY FRIND ''+4 +4 +4 +4''\",\"R.

Symbols take a ton of memory space to learn since you have to connect them to words in your head anyway, and I get really turned off reading text with too many of them. I feel like MTG does symbols really well: it has 7 recurring symbols (the 5 mana symbols, the colorless mana symbol, and the tap symbol), but all of these fall into categories (mana and tapping). The mana symbols don't take much memory space to tell them apart from each other because they're all the same size and shape, so really you have two symbols- mana symbols and tapping. 2 symbols is a lot easier to memorize than 5 or more, which is something I see in a lot of games nowadays. The symbols in MTG also don't come up when describing interactions between cards. MTG never uses the tap symbol to tell you that a card taps down an opposing creature, only to tell you to tap a card for an effect.\",\"Fax\",\"@@Ashy_Washy go check\",\"Yu-go-oh 2\",\"bro that's a good edit for uno!\",\"This is almost a 1 year old legendary movie and nostalgia but still is a banger! 2025 edits boutta be lit 🔥🔥🔥\",\"Bro why did bro make the calmest game of uno?\",\"He is the UNOED one\",\"yeah\",\"​@@P1x3lz_Th1ngwhat does this have to do with the hard ass uno edit\",\"He did the editing\",\"​@@valeriafernandasheleyberto6009You sure about that.

Also, the art looked amateur. The colors and frames looked like someone slapped them together in Photoshop in under 10 minutes.

In the video Dave said to \\\"keep the rules on the cards, not in a rule book\\\" or something to that effect, then also said to use symbols when text is repeated. The issue is that if the symbols aren't able to be defined on the card because using the symbol at all is meant to keep information concise, then you're offloading the explanation of the symbols to the rule book which is exactly contradictory to the other advice. The important thing is to consider how the information is conveyed. For example, A \\\"tap\\\" symbol like from Magic avoids needing to use the word \\\"tap\\\" or whatever word you use, in my game's case \\\"tax\\\". It's not that these words are very long. In fact the icon is only a few pixels shorter than the word written in the card's text. And when the card text says to \\\"tap target permanent\\\" or whatever in Magic it spells it out instead of using the icon. But the explanation for what this symbol means is entirely in the rule book. Why is this symbol necessary? The reason it's important is that you don't need to read it at all if it's a symbol, and it identifies it as a cost just like the mana costs. You just take it in at a glance, and you understand it to be a cost because other costs such as mana are in the same location on some cards. Why is mana a symbol? To be concise, yes, but it's more than that. It indexes them. They're all circles with different flavor shapes inside and unique colors from one another. The tap symbol is not mana, but it's also kept round and anyway you have to tap the lands to generate mana, so it's the same function just moved to the card itself. The most important amendment I'd make to the golden rule described in the video about when to use symbols is to use them whenever you would otherwise be repeating a key word, or key phrase, which is only slightly worded differently than the video itself but has a core meaning change. Remember that the reason is because the repeated phrase is important because it has depth that must be precise and universal. It's law. If it didn't need to be taken as law, it wouldn't need to be repeated in the exact same way every time and then fully explained in the rule book. The ability text that's written on a card is a contract, but a contract is just a paper covered in words until the court of law steps in to enforce it. Keywords are law themselves which contracts refer to for authority, and icons replacing keywords are done when the law needs to be identified as similar to one another and therefor indexed together in your mind, or when the keywords are too verbose like my comments. Red circle and blue circle are both indexed as mana in Magic, and mana is currency backed by law. Sometimes the mana symbol is there when it's provided, and sometimes removed. No need for the mana to have a + or - on it, though, because the contract outlines the terms like in all other contracts. Just know that the card has a purchase receipt in the top right corner which is always mana removed by using placement on the card as a language, and the card effect sections have a spot for mana removed as well at the start of the effect, and also for tapping in the same spot. If you find mana inside the text body, however, you need to refer to the rest of the effect contract to see how the law will apply this symbol. Also numbers are just symbols in language that have mathematical laws backing them as well. When you use numbers you're just using symbols who's rulebooks are taught thoroughly at school. 1 is an image that replaces the key word \\\"one\\\", just like 1\\u002f2 replaces \\\"one half\\\", but if you use them just right you can have your rulebook override some mathematical key words such as in Magic when 1\\u002f2 means \\\"1 power and 2 toughness\\\". This is another case of Magic using location as a form of language. 1 is a mathematical keyword that could be anywhere, but because of its location relative to the rest of the card and especially the \\u002f beside it this 1 also means \\\"power\\\" which is a separate keyword also defined in the rule book. Together these mean \\\"one power\\\", which is relevant to like 50 paragraphs of text for \\\"power\\\" in the completed rule book, and entire math degrees worth of information to fully define \\\"one\\\". Anyway, I went on a bit of a ramble there. Gonna get back to eating my lunch. 😅\",\"​@@Depressed_until_dead Gojo will be Go\\u002fJo\",\"@@Shivas-cj7vr 🤔😑\",\"😮😮😮😮😮😮😮\",\"girl a @@Éxodo337\",\"You know you're talented when you can make an UNO EDIT better than some movies.\",\"Frrr\",\"░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░\",\"I know it's a year old video (still useful) but I can't keep quiet about the fact that I like the first simple card waaaay more than the new one, which feels visually overwhelming imo.

And yes, I'm right handed. So anyway in conclusion idk if that rule which you said is actually true or not, honestly. I mean the rule sure but he using left vs right not that sure. Maybe I do it like that because in the card games I played the most (Yugioh and MTG) it's better to fan the cards like that? I legit have no clue I just know that it feels natural to do it this way and unnatural the other way and that makes me wonder if it's really true that mana values should be in left and not right... I mean in the kind of cards I want to make that doesn't really matters and I guess it's still better to use the top left if possible since we read left-right and top-down but yeah quite weird.\",\"assolutamente sì :) un pozzetto per squadra\",\"Ikr\",\"Fr tho\",\"goat edit\",\"This is the most accurate depiction of UNO yet.\",\"Did you mean “cease to never amaze”\",\"X3=2❤\",\"Yes\",\"How do you edit this\",\"🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤🫰🏿🫰🏿🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏼🫰🏼🫰🏼🫰🏼🫰🏼🫰🏼💸💸💸💸💚🦄🦄🦋🦋🦋🦄🦋🦄🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸\",\"This is, _truly,_ the legendary edit of all time\",\"Cards spinning like that, pretty good animation!

So you might've been better off using a card that actively breaks the rules you then spoke about, instead of a card you worked on in the past that you are personally not that satisfied with.

Neither keywording nor iconising are good ideas. They may make cards appear more readable at a glance, but when you actually try to read them for the sake of playing the game, keywording and iconising significantly reduce readability by requiring the player to reference the rulebook. There's a reason that MTG so strongly avoids doing either, using reminder text wherever font size allows and never adding a new icon that hasn't been a variation on the mana symbol (except for that one time they did the untap symbol for thematic reasons and then never did it again). Icons are especially bad because they break up the flow of a sentence - to be able to read the card, I have to learn how to pronounce your icons, and in many cases those icons' pronunciations aren't intuitive. \\\"read crossed swords as combat value\\\" is definitely not. The only time you can get away with icons is when the icons represent game objects, or maybe object properties, but that should still be done very sparingly, and it's a lot less likely to work in a card game than it is a board game.

In the video Dave said to \\\"keep the rules on the cards, not in a rule book\\\" or something to that effect, then also said to use symbols when text is repeated. The issue is that if the symbols aren't able to be defined on the card because using the symbol at all is meant to keep information concise, then you're offloading the explanation of the symbols to the rule book which is exactly contradictory to the other advice. The important thing is to consider how the information is conveyed. For example, A \\\"tap\\\" symbol like from Magic avoids needing to use the word \\\"tap\\\" or whatever word you use, in my game's case \\\"tax\\\". It's not that these words are very long. In fact the icon is only a few pixels shorter than the word written in the card's text. And when the card text says to \\\"tap target permanent\\\" or whatever in Magic it spells it out instead of using the icon. But the explanation for what this symbol means is entirely in the rule book. Why is this symbol necessary? The reason it's important is that you don't need to read it at all if it's a symbol, and it identifies it as a cost just like the mana costs. You just take it in at a glance, and you understand it to be a cost because other costs such as mana are in the same location on some cards. Why is mana a symbol? To be concise, yes, but it's more than that. It indexes them. They're all circles with different flavor shapes inside and unique colors from one another. The tap symbol is not mana, but it's also kept round and anyway you have to tap the lands to generate mana, so it's the same function just moved to the card itself. The most important amendment I'd make to the golden rule described in the video about when to use symbols is to use them whenever you would otherwise be repeating a key word, or key phrase, which is only slightly worded differently than the video itself but has a core meaning change. Remember that the reason is because the repeated phrase is important because it has depth that must be precise and universal. It's law. If it didn't need to be taken as law, it wouldn't need to be repeated in the exact same way every time and then fully explained in the rule book. The ability text that's written on a card is a contract, but a contract is just a paper covered in words until the court of law steps in to enforce it. Keywords are law themselves which contracts refer to for authority, and icons replacing keywords are done when the law needs to be identified as similar to one another and therefor indexed together in your mind, or when the keywords are too verbose like my comments. Red circle and blue circle are both indexed as mana in Magic, and mana is currency backed by law. Sometimes the mana symbol is there when it's provided, and sometimes removed. No need for the mana to have a + or - on it, though, because the contract outlines the terms like in all other contracts. Just know that the card has a purchase receipt in the top right corner which is always mana removed by using placement on the card as a language, and the card effect sections have a spot for mana removed as well at the start of the effect, and also for tapping in the same spot. If you find mana inside the text body, however, you need to refer to the rest of the effect contract to see how the law will apply this symbol. Also numbers are just symbols in language that have mathematical laws backing them as well. When you use numbers you're just using symbols who's rulebooks are taught thoroughly at school. 1 is an image that replaces the key word \\\"one\\\", just like 1\\u002f2 replaces \\\"one half\\\", but if you use them just right you can have your rulebook override some mathematical key words such as in Magic when 1\\u002f2 means \\\"1 power and 2 toughness\\\". This is another case of Magic using location as a form of language. 1 is a mathematical keyword that could be anywhere, but because of its location relative to the rest of the card and especially the \\u002f beside it this 1 also means \\\"power\\\" which is a separate keyword also defined in the rule book. Together these mean \\\"one power\\\", which is relevant to like 50 paragraphs of text for \\\"power\\\" in the completed rule book, and entire math degrees worth of information to fully define \\\"one\\\". Anyway, I went on a bit of a ramble there.

For one of them, I'm trying to replace every single line of text in the dungeon crawling cards with symbols, and even if it's easy to read if you know what the symbols mean, it will probably be overwhelming for the new players and I will probably need to make a full document explaining each card (but it wont be included in the game, just a link to access it). The item cards have the symbols in the text box, and the cost at the top.right corner, but the cost is for buying only (deckbuilder) so it's not needed after it's purchased and in the player's hand. The second game has 11 spaces for icons at the right side of the cards, which are present in all cards regardless of type. The icons on those spaces vary depending on the type, but the general theme of the icons share the same spot. I'm still working on the design, tho, but the idea is fine i think, I just need it to look more professional.\",\"Not a designer by any means, but personally I'd add on that you don't only use symbols, but also keywords. Instead of \\\"take 3 tamage each turn for 2 turns\\\" Say \\\" 🩸*Bleed* 3 for 2 turns\\\" And if your games relies on stacking cards, and several cards depend on what's around them, that could become a keyword too. \\\" Gain multicolored Mana. *Above Green* : gain attack \\\" Something like that. Maybe a card can have different effects based on the card below. Like *Above Green:* Gain attack *Above Red:* Gain health\",\"Lefties can’t uncover the cost without covering the name of the card.

Yes you are correct, many people play by the winning number per round wins that round and the best 2 out of 3 rounds wins. Other people like to write down the number of points they won per hand and the game is won by the first person to exceed 150 (or 300) points at the end of a round. In this way it's not the best 2 out of 3 hands, rather a race to the set point number. Give it a try, both are great ways to play.

I think it comes from playing video games as much as I have, but it was also because I specifically fan my cards the way I do due to Magic Card layouts. The power and toughness is very inconveniently under my right hand thumb, but knowing the cost rules out cards before their power and toughness is relevant anyway, so I can move my thumb to see that or the card effect. Whichever I need to see right now. Memorizing my cards also lets me only consider them on if I can play them or not, which means my method of fanning which is just \\\"reverse how you do it\\\" and is just as easy and viable as your method. Not sure why you do it that way unless you're playing Poker, honestly. But anyway, that's not a flaw on the cards. It's a very minor mistake in your method of holding them. In the case of Magic the cost is simply on the same side as the power and toughness to allow you to expose both at the same time. This is particularly useful is OG Magic where you had many monsters that only had a power and toughness and no effect, so you could stack them to cover everything except the card's colors (in the cost), and power and toughness on the same side. I'm not making this comment to say \\\"you're wrong\\\" because you're not! Just like with your method of fanning your hand works best for Poker and some other games but not for Magic, it's an element of the game that's designed for. There is no \\\"correct location\\\" for a cost. There is only a \\\"best location for your game\\\" for a cost assuming you have a cost. So yeah, you're right in your case, but I wanted to make this comment to help anyone new to game design understand that like all other examples and rules of design the location of your card's cost is up to interpretation within the confines of your game. Also try fanning your Magic cards out with your thumb instead.\",\"You earned yourself a sub\",\"Great video, the video production was top notch\",\"\\\"under exaggerated\\\"got me\",\"I wish it was less obvious tips ^_^\",\"Can't think of anything interesting to comment rn.

Why? I have no idea. People are being cheated every single day wether they are playing live or online. It doesn't matter if you are playing a tournament or a cash game you are so likely to be cheated. From the smallest micro stakes online to the highest stakes at your local casino, you can't escape it. Collusion, marked cards, RTA (real time assistance) are just some of the ways people cheat. Even if you are not being cheated the casual recreational player has very little chance of winning in the long run. The amount of strategy information on the game is overwhelming. There are an endless supply of books on the game. Dozens of training sites. Software online to study your game and track your opponents. Poker Coaches and study groups. Apps on your phone. It's insane really. The game has been broken down and picked apart into tiny little pieces and the amount of study and playing time needed to be competitive and merely break even is just not worth it. My point is that there are other games to play besides NLH. Dozens. Look into the mixed game tournament at the WSOP. Everyone has heard of 7 Card Stud and 5 Card Draw. Those are great games and there are dozens of variations of those games. Badugi, Omaha Hi\\u002fLo 8 or better, Razz, 2-7 Triple Draw, A-5 Triple Draw, 7 Card Stud Hi\\u002fLo 8 or Better, Limit Holdem, No-Limit 2-7 Single Draw, Pot Limit Omaha (PLO)...The list goes on. So if you want to play some poker try a mixed game.

Looking at regular playing cards (like poker cards), while some cards have the name on all 4 corners, a lot of the biggest brands (like Bicycle) have the name of the card only on the top-left and bottom-right. It seems to be generally accepted as a common practice to fan cards with the top-left corner visible. And the only peoples I've met that complained about it were left-handed, so maybe there is something about the majority of right-handed peoples finding it easier to fan that way while the majority of left-handed peoples finding it easier to fan the other way. As for my own experience, I'm right-handed, and I hold card with my left-hand so that I can play with my right hand. While with two hands I can fan both ways, if I try to fan only with my left hand (and I do one-handed fanning most of the time), it's much easier for me to fan to show the top-left corner. I can do it with one sweep of my big thumb, while I need multiple tries and\\u002for some helps from my other fingers to fan the other way.\",\"Riassunto del video: bicycle\",\"@@sc1theManga.

As for the Magic Card, sure there's some minor merit to your Rule 1, but it's *very* minor. As you say later, the cards in your hand are indeed the cards you put into your deck, so you don't need the mana cost visible all the time while you have things tightly fanned. People have object permanence and minor memory capacities. They can see the mana cost (and other info) and then remember it for most cards even when it's obscured. Furthermore, The mana cost being on the left side under the name of Tarmogoyf now causes two problems. First is that it's obscuring the picture, and the picture is the most important thing because - again - people remember the info on their own cards. They just need to recognize which card they have, and that mana cost there is obscuring the image if there are similar 1-F green cards. Two, the beauty of Magic cards is that everything is placed in its own relevant space, so you can find the information you want about the card by looking at a distinct section of it. name, image, mana cost, creature type, power\\u002ftoughness, effects (and sometimes flavor text). They're partitioned out so everything is clear and the info for one section doesn't distract from info in another section. This puts the mana cost and the name in the same spot, and makes the mana cost unclear because of the curved behavior. This works for something that costs some colorless mana and a single colored mana, but what if it cost 3 forests? 5 forests? Now the mana cost design has to curve around and make the spacing uneven and make counting harder. So your format is either going to suck for some cards, or you're going to only use this format for cards with few colored mana, making a split standard which makes it that much worse to look at cards and evaluate their information at a glance. Because now you need to look in two different locations with two different formats for mana cost. Which is why that Gangar card is such cancer. The image now covers the whole damn thing, being distracting in general and making reading any of the text a nightmare. Well defined borders and information is important. And no, it doesn't have to be \\\"most to least important, top to bottom\\\" like some kind of passage in a book. The important thing is that relevant information is visible, and in its own space so you can instantly fixate on whatever information is most Sorry but, while this video was nicely produced, you're speaking like these design rules are gospel. And that'd be fine if they were fundamental and ironclad but, frankly, they're arbitrary, poorly supported, and often missing what's important. You're not arranging text on a page or trying to tell a whole cards story from the 10% visible in a tightly fanned hand. You want each card, individually, to have its information clear, organized, identifiable, and recognizable. Absolute location doesn't matter as much as being distinct. People's memory takes care of the rest. And because it's so bad, I have to say it a third time. That Gangar card was cancer and you ought to be ashamed for holding that up as some kind of implication that players \\\"just don't know what's good for them.\\\"\",\"holy shit 128k likes\",\"​@@luffy-san321but he edited tho\",\"You did so good you are the sigma\",\"Oh fr fr?\",\"I mean thay can’t keep things straight thare😭🙏\",\"This isn't animated\",\"@@ZachXFire79not really not swaggy enough\",\"I was very curious how simple solitaire hooked you until you said it was by Zachtronics then it all made sense\",\"comeque sempre di più.credo che tra due anni saranno cossi tante da riempire tutta la casa!\",\"GRANDE JACKKK!\",\"Sadly true ​@@max-abobea\",\"This is a work of art\",\"We will get u to 10M one day brother\",\"idk why this is that much popular but yeah i like it\",\"​@@Vantastic789I feel their problem is, you don't buy the Jokers and extra decks from their shop.

The design of magic cards is so well made for speed-reading a card and giving you all the information you need in a glance. Magic is like the street fighter of card games, and the fact that the design of the cards has not changed much is a sign of how well designed are they. Not perfect, but clearly effective. Considering you are playing, that you know the cards in your deck, and that you are thinking about the gameplay rather than the visuals: Name being on top, cost and power being in the same side means you can hold 7 cards in your hand have all the relevant information to know what cards you have just with 10% of the actual cards visible. By revealing 10 % more of the card, you may recognize the art, and you only need to fully see the card if you need to read the text, which is often keyworded for speed. A full read of the card is only needed once when you draw the card, where its all visible anyway, or as a quick reminder while playing. I've always held cards in my hand in a way this is obvious. You just need to fan the cards the other way. As a designer, when you see a flaw on the top dogs, you need to ask yourself whether or not you are the one making a mistake, and analyse why that mistake is there, rather than thinking \\\"its old, they didnt know any better, and players dont want it to change because they are dumb\\\". That said, the design of yugi-ho text is horrendous for new players.\",\"​​@@satibelYour pixel analogy is mistaken unfortunately. That's not what a Turing Machine is. It's basically a line of infinite counters that go from 0 to infinity and a paper that tells you the rules to move and whether to increase or decrease the counter you're at by 1. Notably, a deck of cards does not have rules to change that deck by, so it is not Turing Complete. Magic the Gathering is a set of rules combined with playing cards which can act as the counters, that's why it's Turing Complete, because through its cards + rules you can have infinite loops i.e. infinite counters\",\"😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 me voy a morir con eso y si yo y me saca esos todas esas cartas❤\",\"Y'all I meant it as a joke or sarcasm, what I meant was that uno was not in the bible, so I just wanted to correct the guy\",\"Now you know*\",\"🫥 i hope they put your ass to work lil man\",\"Sì tranne per chiudere la partita\",\"This is to good\",\"All in\",\"@@lakrids-pibe Yes it was just played at upscale Strip Casinos here in Las Vegas.

It is 100% on you to back up your own arguments. It's not my responsibility to validate your information, that's not how discussions work. I've done more than enough research on the topic at hand. If that's the case, and you weren't talking about MTG, then the entirety of everything you've said is irrelevant. I was specifically discussing MTG - this seems like quite the cop out to me. It was plainly obvious the topic was about MTG, so the fact you're here now pretending it somehow wasn't is absurd. Not being able to post links is also a complete cop out. You don't need links to direct people somewhere. You could have easily said 'Look at Dr. John Doe's paper titled 'design flaws in cards and how they effect play'' or some such. The simple fact of the matter is you have no evidence, insignificant backing credentials, and have nothing to hold up the enormous high horse you're sitting on.

In that moment I knew I was gonna fit right in :)\",\"@@LibertyMonk The \\\"Art is Paramount\\\" in my opinion helps MtG get away with it. There are a handful of cards I don't know the name of in my deck but I know their art and the art of these cards is easier to see upside-down (as the opponent) so I tend to focus more on the art of the card and recognise it rather than trying to see the name. And besides that, the name isn't really important. The cost, power\\u002ftoughness and effect are easily more relevant than the name and those can be seen by fanning it displaying top right. In my country at least, nearly all playing card brands display information in all 4 corners. If you asked me to name every card in even my most played MtG deck off the top of my head I couldn't. I could survive with having the names blacked out for every card as I recognised their art, the combination of costs and effects. Obviously, when learning the alternate arts and new sets, names are important but in my opinion, art, cost and power\\u002ftoughness make all spells far more recognisable than name. This may differ from other peoples experiences and card games but that's why I think MtG gets away with it.\",\"Its a great battle for claim victorious\",\"This was a sick animation\",\"Love this, thank you!\",\"I spent 3 minutes telling myself I would find this exact comment when I open the comment section and I was right\",\"🤨🤫🧏🧏🤫😱😱😱😱😱💀💀💀💀💀\",\"Running away to become a magician is also known as ‘planes walking’\",\"fr bro was like give me a sec i need a sip\",\"Che collezione fantastica jack la vorei anch'io per il mio compleanno chiedo di escrivermi al tuo corso di magia e sono felicissima\",\"exactly my thought... it just depends on how you fan out your cards, not if the symbol is on the left or right.@@Jerom_\",\"If UNO had an anime.\",\"\\\"So whats your favorite anime?\\\" \\\"U N O\\\"\",\"Art serves a extremely important function: it allows people to mentally chunk the effects of a card to an image. It's much easier to tell apart images than blocks of text, especially with cards in hand. After reading my cards, I can remember what they do at a glance by seeing the artwork. Yu-Gi-Oh especially utilizes this. Then there's the connections between art and effects, if the art is of a magical effect, I expect a spell, it gets me in the right mindset to understand the effect of the card. If the art is a big monster, I expect a big monster stats.

If fifty-two cards to a deck and fifty-two weeks to a year, there must be some way to make it work out to find the date, right? – Here’s how. You have to first remember this order of suits: Spade, Diamond, Club, Heart. Knowing this order will note each week of the month as Week-1, Week-2, Week-3, and Week-4. So, for January 1st, it would strictly be the Ace of Spades, and the same card will be used to note the top of the first week in the order of weeks following a second card that marks the day(not weekday) of that week. So by placing a four of any suit, you mark yourself on a picture frame that it is the “fourth day of the first week” of January being January 4th. This methodology works only by using up to the number 7 card. Because by following the order, on the 8th you will replace the initial week card to the Ace of Diamonds, and it represents the 8th of January by its sole self. You then use the cards 2-7 to mark the day of the days of week as they progress through. You have to note that when changing the Week card in following this order, the cards themselves to the number of that month will only represent the 1st, the 8th, the 15th, and the 22nd. The second card, being any suit 2-7, represents the numbered day within that week. When you get to the end of the week, you can only get to a maximum of the 28th. After that, respective of the same order reveals a pattern where you can use the Kings for the 29th, 30th, and 31st. – So, a Four of Hearts with a King of Diamonds means it would be the 30th of April. And then the following day becomes the Five of Spades, noting the first of May. There’s been a third card adding to the collective of two cards during this period. Another set of 1-7 cards used to represent the day of the week. Not much of this has been mentioned, but there’s speculation as to what day begins the day of the week: M-1, T-2, W-3, Th-4, F-5, Sa-6, Su-7. There’s nothing stopping you from setting apart a specific suit for noting this function from the aforementioned perspective. Perhaps you use a picture frame and stick the second card behind the Week Counter card, and use a Joker in front of the weekday card. This is what I found that works.\",\"Man has 59k likes nice on a single comment\",\"For those who are interested in learning poker...

All that I know is that they aren’t around any more. Most of the businesses in Reading during the 19th Century aren’t around any more. Theres a street here called Benson St and back then it had tons of shops like ice cream shops, barber shops, furniture stores, and a popular theatre called Emery Theater, However now Benson St is a Bridal District (the biggest one in Cincinnati and I think Ohio) and one of the buildings had a big Uno card painted on the side. I do know that Merle Robbins son, Ray Robbins and his wife were teachers at Hilltop Elementary School (which is where I went to elementary school. But it’s also no longer around) and he handed out their Uno game and supposedly another game he invented called Thunder. The original card decks have his home address on them which was a street called W Crest which is the same street my grandma lives on. After seeing pictures of the original cards they look so familiar and I know I’ve played with them in the past. I just can’t remember if I own them, or if they were at my grandmas house, or if I played with them in elementary school.\",\"So, i have a game from Italy that not many italians know. It is a variation of the much more famous game Scopa, and it is played with the 40 card italian deck (you can also play with the french standard deck using only the first seven cards per suit and the figure cards). It is called Ruspo. To learn Ruspo you first have to learn Scopa, wich is played as follows (the game can be played in 4 or in 2, but I will teach how to play for two players): HOW TO PLAY SCOPA The game starts by dealing three cards to the players and putting four cards on the table. The card values are as follows: The first seven cards of each suit are worth face values, the Jack is worth 8, the Horse (in Italy it's called Horse not Knight) or Queen is worth 9, and the King is worth 10. In turns, starting with the player that DIDN'T deal the cards, the players play cards and take cards from the table of equal value to the card they played. For example, the first player plays a king, in the table there is 2, 7, 3, 4; so the player that played the king will take the 3, the 7 and the king they played, wich =10, and will put the card in front of them face down (if instead of 2, 7, 3, 4 there was 2, 7, king, 3 the player that played the king would have directly taken the king). It is now the other player's turn. If a player doesn't have anything to take, they simply play a card on the table. This continues until the players don't have any more cards in their hands, so the dealer will deal three more cards to the players. If a player in a given moment plays a card and takes every card on the table (for example: 2 and 4 on the table and the player plays 6) they say \\\"scopa\\\" and marks it with a face up card on their deck of cards they took. On the last round, wich is when there are no more cards to deal and the players have their last three cards, when all players don't have any more cards to play the cards on the table get taken by the last person that took cards from the table. The game is over, and now it's time to assing the points. You gain a point by: - each scopa you did - If you have Re Bello (King of coins or King of diamonds) - If you have Settebello (Seven of coins or seven of diamonds) - If you have more cards than the opponent, if it's a tie no one gains this point - If you have more sevens than the opponent, if they tie you count the six, and if they also are tied this point isn't counted - If you have more coins or diamonds that the opponent, if they tie this point isn't counted The first to arrive to 21 points wins, if both players arrive at 21, they continue playing until one wins more points at the end of a match. HOW TO PLAY RUSPO (IN MY OPINION THE BETTER VERSION) The game is played like scopa, and the points at the end of the match are counted in the same way, but there are this changes: If on the first four cards on the table an Ace shows up, you put another card on the table, put the Ace in the deck and shuffle it. Instead of taking by playing a card face up, you take by playing a card face down, so this allows the players to cheat (for example, there is a 7 on the table, the player cheats by playing a 6 face down and takes the 7). Of course, the players can also take with the correct card, but they still have to play it face down. The player that didn't play can doubt what the other player did before them: if they doubt the cards that have been taken on the turn before are revealed, if the player that played the cards played correctly, they keep the cards and mark a scopa, if they cheated, they put the cards they took on that turn on the table and the opponent marks a scopa. The opponent has to doubt the other player's action before he plays a card, if it was the last card, before they see the new cards. The Aces are special cards: the player can play an Ace face down and say \\\"ruspo\\\" then take all the cards on the table, even if there aren't any; taking all the cards with an Ace does not mark a scopa. Clearly, the player can do a ruspo with every card, not just an Ace, as long as the opponent doesn't doubt; if they doubt, the mechanism explained before is applied. If the player can't or doesn't want to take they can also choose to play a card on the table like normal. The point at the end are counted the same way as Scopa, the first to arrive to 41 points wins.\",\"How??? Tutorial needed😂\",\"Sono tantissime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tarocchi is a different animal entirely and besides the naming of the 5th suit any representation of who they might have been based on is not at all standardized. I’ll be uploading Tarot next month.

Most people can't visualize a 2\\u002f25 chance, but they can understand \\\"if you draw an ace.\\\" It also helps to control the spread of options. For example, in dice-based games, there is no limit to your ability to roll well or roll poorly, which means one person _could_ never roll under 15 on their raw D20 while the next person never rolls over 5. But a limited number and selection of playing cards means you can only ever get four kings, four 2s, etc. This makes them useful for the indie TTRPG designers I know who want to ensure nobody has an accidental advantage or disadvantage in play.

Looking at regular playing cards (like poker cards), while some cards have the name on all 4 corners, a lot of the biggest brands (like Bicycle) have the name of the card only on the top-left and bottom-right. It seems to be generally accepted as a common practice to fan cards with the top-left corner visible. And the only peoples I've met that complained about it were left-handed, so maybe there is something about the majority of right-handed peoples finding it easier to fan that way while the majority of left-handed peoples finding it easier to fan the other way. As for my own experience, I'm right-handed, and I hold card with my left-hand so that I can play with my right hand. While with two hands I can fan both ways, if I try to fan only with my left hand (and I do one-handed fanning most of the time), it's much easier for me to fan to show the top-left corner. I can do it with one sweep of my big thumb, while I need multiple tries and\\u002for some helps from my other fingers to fan the other way.\",\"This editing is drippy\",\"Complimenti jack👌😉\",\"Tarocchi bellissimo in 5 bello anche in 4 ma sono anni che non trovo giocatori 😕\",\"Vabbène\",\"Masters truly at their peak\",\"SHIT SLAPS HARDER THEN MOST ANIMES RN😅\",\"Bella Jack sei un grande, come la tua collezione\",\"..... | | ..... 0o0\",\"0:00\",\"First comment to get to 1k likes\",\"An absolutely personal opinion: As much as I enjoy playing poker I 100% abhor the overly lauded game of Texas Holdem'.

Yu-Gi-Oh especially utilizes this.

Knowing when to use graphics and when to just leave it streamlined is a huge thing for card design. In my experience the most important information is: What kind of card is it When can i use it (instant vs sorcery) What and how much resources does it use What it actually does.

But that's it. Hearthstone gets away with it, because they assist with highlighted borders. A card that can be played is green. A card that targets a minion can't be played with no minions on the field, even if the cost is within your current budget. A card that has a special effect gets a yellow border.

In fact, it allows a fine grain hierarchy on the power level, even when there are effects that manipulate those stats. For example, a monster with 2450 atk is stronger than a 2400 but weaker than a 2500. And even if an effect halves their atk, the monster has 1225 atk, wich keeps it stronger than the 1200 and weaker than the 1250. If there were only 2 digits, all three would have 12 atk, removing the power hierarchy on them. Also, there are archetypes that can take advantage of halving your life points. If you have 8000 life points, you can half them 12 times (keeping 1 LP). If you had only 2 digits, you could only half 6 times your 80 LP.\",\"👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 JUST WOW!!!\",\"Io pensavo fosse una marca di modellini di automobili da collezione 😂\",\"Am old and still don't get it.

I've never had an issue in identifying the cards though and I dont know anyone that has such an issue even when fanning out the cards in their hand and the names are covered up. Tbh, as long as you are able to recognise the card and know the effect, you can play even if you aren't able to read any of the words on the card. In that train of thought, the art of a card is probably more important than the actual name in helping you recognise it.\",\"What a nice piece.

You're literally telling me to ignore my personal experience based on the advice of a random guy on the internet. My point is that while the cards aren't perfect, the location of the mana value isn't so bad it could be considered a design flaw. Sure, some information might be hidden in some case because some players might hold their hand in a way that hides the information BUT all they have to do, if they want that information, is slightly adjust their fingers.

In fact, it allows a fine grain hierarchy on the power level, even when there are effects that manipulate those stats. For example, a monster with 2450 atk is stronger than a 2400 but weaker than a 2500. And even if an effect halves their atk, the monster has 1225 atk, wich keeps it stronger than the 1200 and weaker than the 1250. If there were only 2 digits, all three would have 12 atk, removing the power hierarchy on them. Also, there are archetypes that can take advantage of halving your life points. If you have 8000 life points, you can half them 12 times (keeping 1 LP). If you had only 2 digits, you could only half 6 times your 80 LP.\",\"That's why it's so big\",\"So where the part of ancient egyptians summoning monster?\",\"This needs to be a movie series\",\"really good and funny script and absolutely excellent delivery on this one!!!\",\"Oh great catch!

Additionally, there are 4 french-suited decks, all with 40 cards, namely Milanesi, Toscane, Genovesi and Piemontesi. Finally, there's also a German-suited 40 card deck, the Salisburghesi, totaling 16 visually and sometimes mechanically different decks across all Italy. But that's not all!

The seven books of the Apocrypha\\u002fDeuterocanon were not recognised by all Catholics prior to the Reformation, and hence were not part of the canon. (Hence the name Deuterocanon - literally, second canon - adopted by the RC Church.) The RC Church unilaterally made these books canonical after the Reformation at the Council of Trent. Several doctrines and dogmas of the RC Church, such as purgatory, rely heavily on these books which Protestants do not believe Divinely inspired. Protestants do not deprecate these books: they have a high regard for them. So highly are they regarded, that in English Bibles it was common for them to be printed in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments, right through to the 19th century. Personally I think they should still be printed there, although I can understand the reasoning of those who take the opposite view. Two final points: first, Martin Luther did not determine the books of the Protestant Bible, there were a multitude of Reformers who reached a consensus; and second, your opinion that somehow the Protestant Bibles use corrupted texts is erroneous. The King James Bible, the most famous of them, is arguably the first \\\"modern\\\" Bible in the western world, based on extensive scholarship, providing a synthesis of all original manuscripts available at that time. From a scholarly point of view, although the beauty of its language remains unequalled, it has since been superceded by new translations (based on academic advances and older manuscripts that have become available over the last 400 years, which were unknown to the original translators).\",\"​@@rosdimohd1738soon to be 1000 likes.

Era un gioco bellissimo e molto avvincente, si poteva giocare in 3-4 o 5 giocatori, ognuno per proprio conto senza accoppiamenti. La sostanza del gioco era che si dovevano chiudere le otto carte pescando o dal tallone o dallo scarto del giocatore che precedeva. Con la possibilità di rinunciare a pescare e \\\"battere\\\" pagando 1, 2 o 3 punti. Gli altri giocatori pagavano tutte le carte non sistemate a combinazioni di tre, quattro o più carte. Se si chiudevano tutte le otto carte si aveva diritto a togliere -10 punti dal proprio punteggio mentre gli altri pagavano sempre le carte non \\\"sistemate\\\" come detto sopra. Il gioco finiva quando un solo giocatore rimaneva con un punteggio inferiore 71 punti. Il gioco finiva anche quando un giocatore sistemava tutte le otto carte secondo una scala reale o una combinazione di otto carte uguali (otto 2, otto 3, otto 4... etc.) Queste ultime 2 combinazioni si pagavano con il doppio o il triplo della posta. Vi assicuro che ci si divertiva tantissimo a prescindere dal valore della posta e sopratutto era un gioco che richiedeva la max concentrazione perchè poi c'erano diverse altre regole che impedivano e punivano ogni distrazione...

Sei un mito e ti stimo per quello che fai e per l tua grande passione Continua così\",\"It is a feature most people won't need or use and can potentially be conceived as non-essential clutter, why it shouldn't be a golden rule. But I do agree, that it at the very least should be a consideration during the design phase. If used it should only be placed in non-intrusive place so it doesn't shift focus. This rules out the corner of a card as an option, but something like faded text integrated to the bottom of a picture or perhaps at the bottom of the card itself are more valid options. The latter is what MTG use now, apparently called \\\"collection number\\\". I'm not a fan of it because it is ugly - but it is fine, I guess. Not something I have any use for. There can be some gains. Like in games where the number is integral to the game mechanics (e.g. Bang! where a number\\u002fsuit can blow you up or save you from being shot), or games where additional rules often is needed (makes for faster rulebook index). Looking up a number is definitely faster than names\\u002fwords. It doesn't matter in simple games (e.g. Settlers of Catan, where all cards are numbered) and where a little extra clutter won't make much difference. OT: Getting increasingly annoyed of all the different languages of games. You can relatively easily get hold of the German, French or Dutch version of games like Oriflamme here in the EU, but you'll often need to double or triple the cost to import a proper English\\u002finternational version.

Third reason is we, if you would as part of the holy tradition. It's part of the things that the Holy Spirit gave us through the body of the church.

You dont need two different spheres of different colours to define attack and defense values, information like tribe or the colour of a card does not need to be communicated as a large sigil in the center of the card. Knowing when to use graphics and when to just leave it streamlined is a huge thing for card design. In my experience the most important information is: What kind of card is it When can i use it (instant vs sorcery) What and how much resources does it use What it actually does.

Japan didn't get playing cards from China, instead it was Portuguese missionaries and traders who brought cards with them. They were then declared illegal and only criminals would play with them. Hanafuda was actually created as a way to play cards without using what looks like actual playing cards. Nintendo started as a cardmaking company. 2. Italian cards, much like spanish cards, don't really have a queen, instead they have a cavalryman. The queens appear of course in italian tarot decks. 3. Tarot was actually created for card games too! The major arcana were originally the suit of triumphs (it. trionfi), which appropriately triumphs over the other four suits. From this word we get the english word \\\"trump\\\" and german \\\"Trumpf\\\". In france, the game of french tarot is the second most popular traditional card game. Tarot de Marseilles is still made with card play in mind under the name of \\\"tarocco piemontese\\\" in Italy. Tarocco Bolognese is still alive and well in Bologna. 4. The Swiss have their own set of suits also! The swiss suits are a variant of german suits, where leaves are replaced by shields and hearts by roses. These cards are usually called Jasskarte because they're predominantly used to play games of the jass family (like clobyosh or belote, though swiss jasses form a whole sub-family of their own), and to the point that games that are not jasses but are played with these cards are called jass too, e.g. Kaiserjass aka Kaiserspiel (which is a direct descendant of the oldest known european game, Karnöffel) 5. Rank and suit indices are actually a fairly recent addition! A lot of italian latin-suited (and even french-suited) regional decks, which generally are pretty old patterns, have no indices.\",\"Fr🎉\",\"20million likes on TikTok, 🫡 respect\",\"Uno game!!!!! 1111!!!\",\"@@Play-In-Games One traditional Spanish card game that we play in Mexico is called Conquian.

Despite the fact that Italy became an independent country only in 1861, an Italian national identity has been existing since the Middle Ages, even if it wasn't as strong as it has been since the 19th century. Dante Alighieri (who lived in the second half of the 13th century) was the first one who tried to invent an Italian language that could create a bond between the various people that lived in the Italian peninsula. Many other Italian men have tried to encourage their countrymen to join together in one state throughout the centuries, long before 1861. Also, the name \\\"Italy\\\" (\\\"Italia\\\" in Latin) was given to the peninsula by the ancient Romans centuries before the birth of Christ. Admittedly, the inhabitants of Italy at the time were called Italics, not Italians, but the peninsula had the same name as today.

We played a version called 7's up, only the 7 cards up were used and the disk cards were shuffled back into the deck. ..., except one night (our hosts 30th birthday party) our host wanted to include a joker as a wild card. Night was going good..., 5 of us playing..., the bets kept going up and up till there was just me and the host left. He kept showing his cards to the guys behind him..., and kept upping the bet, to the point I \\\"HAD\\\" to stop him..., he had bet his entire fortnights wage, which was close enough to $400 (he was married with a new born baby) even threatening to bet me my car against his (I had a Valiant Charger, he had a custom Ford build). The thing was \\\"I KNEW\\\" it was impossible for me to loose and refused to take his bet. In the end I decided enough was enough and called him..., he super proudly and believing he had a winning hand laid down 4 aces..., the look soon turned to horror when I laid down 5 jacks..., the irony is I got the joker on the second group of cards. I had to give him back $20 so he could buy baby formula to feed his kid (no ATM's in those day's).

It's played with a stripped, french- or german-suited 24 card deck (although french suits are much more popular, and you can easily buy pre-shortened french 24s in poland anyway), Ace-Ten family, dare I say \\\"standard\\\" scoring scheme (king=4, queen=3, jack=2, ace=11, ten=10, anything else is worthless) The trump suit is determined by any marriages declared during play, which also scores you additional points - 100 for a marriage in hearts 80 for a marriage in diamonds, 60 for a marriage in clubs, and 40 for a marriage in spades, the trump suit remains until the end of hand or until another marriage is declared.

Anything will be obstructed when you're holding cards on top of each other in your hand, ruining a clear design just to match that rule is bad advice. 2- Just make things you want to be visible, visible. Hierarchy shmierarchy. 3- Just common sense, if you need advice on this you shouldn't be making games. 4- Don't forget to point out to add a cheat sheet in the rulebook that covers all those symbols. 5- YES\",\"A good point.

As for the Magic Card, sure there's some minor merit to your Rule 1, but it's *very* minor. As you say later, the cards in your hand are indeed the cards you put into your deck, so you don't need the mana cost visible all the time while you have things tightly fanned. People have object permanence and minor memory capacities. They can see the mana cost (and other info) and then remember it for most cards even when it's obscured. Furthermore, The mana cost being on the left side under the name of Tarmogoyf now causes two problems. First is that it's obscuring the picture, and the picture is the most important thing because - again - people remember the info on their own cards. They just need to recognize which card they have, and that mana cost there is obscuring the image if there are similar 1-F green cards. Two, the beauty of Magic cards is that everything is placed in its own relevant space, so you can find the information you want about the card by looking at a distinct section of it. name, image, mana cost, creature type, power\\u002ftoughness, effects (and sometimes flavor text). They're partitioned out so everything is clear and the info for one section doesn't distract from info in another section. This puts the mana cost and the name in the same spot, and makes the mana cost unclear because of the curved behavior. This works for something that costs some colorless mana and a single colored mana, but what if it cost 3 forests? 5 forests? Now the mana cost design has to curve around and make the spacing uneven and make counting harder. So your format is either going to suck for some cards, or you're going to only use this format for cards with few colored mana, making a split standard which makes it that much worse to look at cards and evaluate their information at a glance. Because now you need to look in two different locations with two different formats for mana cost. Which is why that Gangar card is such cancer. The image now covers the whole damn thing, being distracting in general and making reading any of the text a nightmare. Well defined borders and information is important. And no, it doesn't have to be \\\"most to least important, top to bottom\\\" like some kind of passage in a book. The important thing is that relevant information is visible, and in its own space so you can instantly fixate on whatever information is most Sorry but, while this video was nicely produced, you're speaking like these design rules are gospel. And that'd be fine if they were fundamental and ironclad but, frankly, they're arbitrary, poorly supported, and often missing what's important. You're not arranging text on a page or trying to tell a whole cards story from the 10% visible in a tightly fanned hand. You want each card, individually, to have its information clear, organized, identifiable, and recognizable. Absolute location doesn't matter as much as being distinct. People's memory takes care of the rest. And because it's so bad, I have to say it a third time. That Gangar card was cancer and you ought to be ashamed for holding that up as some kind of implication that players \\\"just don't know what's good for them.\\\"\",\"mamma di jack: ah, bene! hai comprato un nuovo tappeto...bello dove l'hai preso?!! jack: -_-\",\"Ciao\",\"242 likes with no reply’s lemme fix that\",\"I know Mr beat’s voice anywhere\",\"5M likes in few hours on tiktok 👀\",\"Finalmente aspettavo sto video da un anno\",\"opo\",\"​@@cookafishidshepcd\",\"Bro do a uno chaos one please!!\",\"I agree a lot.

Tbh, as long as you are able to recognise the card and know the effect, you can play even if you aren't able to read any of the words on the card.

I was taught this game by my Sicilian grandfather as a very young child. We played it all the time when I was a young girl. Since then, he’s passed, and I no longer have anyone to ask in my family that recalls how to play! So now I’m a mother of 4 kids and I’ve always wanted to share this with them. Nothing I searched in google came up with any results. I’m sooo excited happy to have come across this video, because I was searching by the wrong word! My grandfather used to say “Gotcha!”- or however you’d spell the word that sounds like “doo-weetie”, which is clearly “to vitti”. (You can understand how a little kid might misunderstand the pronunciation of a word, especially a language she’s not used to.) And google translate for “Gotcha” is “preso”, which I knew for sure it wasn’t called that! So when I watched this video, and heard you pronounce it the way you did, I got a good laugh at my child version of myself misunderstanding what my grandfather EVERY TIME he said “ti vitti” for “doo-weetie”, and was THRILLED to FINALLY find the correct spelling and the game I’ve been searching for for years!

However, having known a number of avid Hold 'Em players back during the early 2000s boom, I learned enough about the game to be very much turned off from every playing for even modest stakes, much less competitively. Besides the psychology aspect (reading your opponents as to the strength of their hand), it was all about memorizing statistical odds (none of which was better than about 40%, IIRC) for a variety of two-card combinations and often betting heavily on the first two cards before even seeing any of the other three.\",\"\\\"Sorry, I had to take a break from dying to get a glass of water\\\" - Technoblade (RIP 😔) bros like that\",\"😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭\",\"The only god I need is the Ace Of Spades\",\"Because you got to.....\\\" Know when to show them ..know when to hold them....\\\"\",\"Another great Simone video\",\"very compact video\",\"I AM POTATO GOD🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔\",\"grande Jack!!!\",\"That's amazing, I'm so glad that this could be a help.

The difference is that you don't get extra points for sweeping the table but Jacks have a power of doing that. So regardless of the nubmer of cards on the table and their number, a Jack can take them all. Jacks, Queens and Kings do not have a number value. Points are given as follows: 1) One point for each club collected 2) One point for more cards collected 3) One point for a two of clubs (\\\"little two\\\") 4) One point for a ten of diamonds (\\\"big ten\\\")\",\"there is only one reason: views💀\",\"Broo the Solo leveling smile hit cold💀\",\"Ho lasciato un commento\",\"Bro!

But I do agree, that it at the very least should be a consideration during the design phase. If used it should only be placed in non-intrusive place so it doesn't shift focus. This rules out the corner of a card as an option, but something like faded text integrated to the bottom of a picture or perhaps at the bottom of the card itself are more valid options. The latter is what MTG use now, apparently called \\\"collection number\\\". I'm not a fan of it because it is ugly - but it is fine, I guess. Not something I have any use for. There can be some gains. Like in games where the number is integral to the game mechanics (e.g. Bang! where a number\\u002fsuit can blow you up or save you from being shot), or games where additional rules often is needed (makes for faster rulebook index). Looking up a number is definitely faster than names\\u002fwords. It doesn't matter in simple games (e.g. Settlers of Catan, where all cards are numbered) and where a little extra clutter won't make much difference. OT: Getting increasingly annoyed of all the different languages of games. You can relatively easily get hold of the German, French or Dutch version of games like Oriflamme here in the EU, but you'll often need to double or triple the cost to import a proper English\\u002finternational version. Games are already expensive enough to get hold on here in Denmark...

There is also a read\\u002fwrite head that can move across the tape. There's other details that are too long (check Wikipedia), but it's basically that a Turing Machine only requires the head to follow a finite series of instructions (e.g. a program) to write and read. It would be trivially easy to chose a representation of 0 (blank) and 1 on a deck of cards (e.g. A-7 = 0, 8-K = 1) and then create a game with rules that mimic Turing Complete operations. The human player would operate as the tape head. Even Turing himself conceived of the original tape this way, with the head being someone literally following a rote set of instructions. @satibel is more or less correct, and even includes memory registers for a display. The limitation of 52 cards isn't actually an issue, because \\\"this is a Turing Machine barring memory limitations\\\" is always a caveat for IRL Turing Machines, as the mathematical one can have infinite memory.

Sure, maybe the design, but for a very long time there was no jokers in most card games. There's a family of card games using the tarot cards, the tarok games. They are very old games of european origin. They have special rules for The Fool card, so you could say that it was the first joker. But for the rest of the games? Karnoffel didn't use them, Piquet doesn't, Skat doesn't, Whist doesn't. Euchre was one of the first modern games to use them, being designated as the second-highest and highest cards of the trump suit. If anything, the major arcana inspired the trump suits in modern games! Before Whist (that's around 17th century I believe?), there was no trumps in most card games. Again, only Tarok had it. And it was the major arcana that was trump! One evidence of that being the case is the card game Piquet, created during the lifetime (maybe a little more) of Jeanne d'Arc, 15th century. No trumps there, all suits equal. And a bit of personal opinion: Piquet is a difficult game, hard to do the hand estimations there.

I think it comes from playing video games as much as I have, but it was also because I specifically fan my cards the way I do due to Magic Card layouts. The power and toughness is very inconveniently under my right hand thumb, but knowing the cost rules out cards before their power and toughness is relevant anyway, so I can move my thumb to see that or the card effect. Whichever I need to see right now. Memorizing my cards also lets me only consider them on if I can play them or not, which means my method of fanning which is just \\\"reverse how you do it\\\" and is just as easy and viable as your method. Not sure why you do it that way unless you're playing Poker, honestly. But anyway, that's not a flaw on the cards. It's a very minor mistake in your method of holding them. In the case of Magic the cost is simply on the same side as the power and toughness to allow you to expose both at the same time. This is particularly useful is OG Magic where you had many monsters that only had a power and toughness and no effect, so you could stack them to cover everything except the card's colors (in the cost), and power and toughness on the same side. I'm not making this comment to say \\\"you're wrong\\\" because you're not! Just like with your method of fanning your hand works best for Poker and some other games but not for Magic, it's an element of the game that's designed for. There is no \\\"correct location\\\" for a cost. There is only a \\\"best location for your game\\\" for a cost assuming you have a cost. So yeah, you're right in your case, but I wanted to make this comment to help anyone new to game design understand that like all other examples and rules of design the location of your card's cost is up to interpretation within the confines of your game. Also try fanning your Magic cards out with your thumb instead.\",\"FR FR bro\",\"I've just bought some of these in Crostia thinking they were regular cards..

Two steps, two million years, etc. This person does this until they've circumnavigated the entire planet. Once them get back to where they started, they then take one drop of water out of the ocean. One million more years, one more step, one more trip around the world, and they take a second drop of water out of the ocean. They do this until there is no water left in the ocean. Once it's dry, they then take a piece of paper and place it on the ground. One more step, one more pass around the world, and then they put one drop of water back in the ocean. This is done until it is full again. A second piece of paper. This process keeps happening until this stack of paper reaches the sun.... 3000 times.

The design of magic cards is so well made for speed-reading a card and giving you all the information you need in a glance. Magic is like the street fighter of card games, and the fact that the design of the cards has not changed much is a sign of how well designed are they. Not perfect, but clearly effective. Considering you are playing, that you know the cards in your deck, and that you are thinking about the gameplay rather than the visuals: Name being on top, cost and power being in the same side means you can hold 7 cards in your hand have all the relevant information to know what cards you have just with 10% of the actual cards visible. By revealing 10 % more of the card, you may recognize the art, and you only need to fully see the card if you need to read the text, which is often keyworded for speed. A full read of the card is only needed once when you draw the card, where its all visible anyway, or as a quick reminder while playing. I've always held cards in my hand in a way this is obvious. You just need to fan the cards the other way. As a designer, when you see a flaw on the top dogs, you need to ask yourself whether or not you are the one making a mistake, and analyse why that mistake is there, rather than thinking \\\"its old, they didnt know any better, and players dont want it to change because they are dumb\\\". That said, the design of yugi-ho text is horrendous for new players.\",\"Ora si ragiona.

There are a handful of cards I don't know the name of in my deck but I know their art and the art of these cards is easier to see upside-down (as the opponent) so I tend to focus more on the art of the card and recognise it rather than trying to see the name. And besides that, the name isn't really important. The cost, power\\u002ftoughness and effect are easily more relevant than the name and those can be seen by fanning it displaying top right. In my country at least, nearly all playing card brands display information in all 4 corners. If you asked me to name every card in even my most played MtG deck off the top of my head I couldn't. I could survive with having the names blacked out for every card as I recognised their art, the combination of costs and effects. Obviously, when learning the alternate arts and new sets, names are important but in my opinion, art, cost and power\\u002ftoughness make all spells far more recognisable than name. This may differ from other peoples experiences and card games but that's why I think MtG gets away with it.\",\"Bro made a simple uno match into a literal anime scene Mad respect.\",\"Wait till you find out animation from talented artists is different than AE edits.\",\"4:36 hey I’ve seen this one before!\",\"Simone, please can you drop the links to your outfits somehwere I want to be you so bad. respectfully.

Typically the “black hand” is only given for winner take all games. When playing for an overall point goal, it’s usually ignored. However you can award a “black hand” bonus for points games.

Trying to find the right balance between table space, readability and theme will lead to the right solution. I have an idea of how I would handle it but it's through the lens of how many cards are laid out in front of players and trying to make a game simple on the surface with hidden depth. A game like Terraforming Mars I find myself stacking some cards because I collect so many, where as Everdell I know I'm capped at a 3x5 grid.
