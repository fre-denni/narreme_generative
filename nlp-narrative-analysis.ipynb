Well I can look at my Wingcrafter (which is a common card) and everything I need to know about the keyword is right there. Now when I get a rare or mythic card that JUST has the keyword I already know what it does. So one variation of your card could read: Gain one colourless power shard (colourless power shard symbol).

If you study Magic cards, you’ll see that while they use, for example, the tap symbol when saying “tap the card to do this”, if they mention tapping in the rest of the text they say the word “tap”. They only have a few symbols that they routinely use in the actual ability text: those for mana costs, and even then it’s used sparingly. People know how to read words, but they don’t come to your game knowing what your symbols mean in the context of your game. If you send them to the reference manual too many times to figure out what your symbols mean it’ll be frustrating.

During your opponent's turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 Monster Card treated as a Continuous Spell on the field; Special Summon it to your field. If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Special Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY. You can only use each effect of \\\"Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon\\\" once per turn. | But if the cards didn't explain all their rulings in the text and only said the most important parts (losing the nuance) a revised friendly version would read like: - Place 1 face-up monster on the field or GY, in its owner's Backrow as a Continuous Spell. - During your opponent's turn (Instant): You can Summon monster treated as a continuous spell to your field. - If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY. It's still a lot of text and Konami had no Idea how ridiculous the game would get and it's funny that removing texy from mosy modern cards msked then infinitely stronger.\",\"11:20 I actually really like card games that have their art in a frame on the card like the big 3 Magic, Pokemon, and Yugioh do. It keeps the image clear and unobscured by mechanical aspects of the game shown in text or icons. It means that when I'm looking at the art I'm looking at the art unobstructed and able to appreciate it fully, and when I'm looking for mechanical components I can find them where I know they will be without the colors and shapes of the art behind them distracting my eye and changing the color and shape language of the area around the game mechanic icon or text. I also care about my cards, and when a nick at the edge of a card damages a black or yellow, or white border or whatever, I don't care so much, but if it damages the edge of the card art I'm much more invested and bummed out by it. I can appreciate the odd full card art style from time to time, but I never use those cards, with the exception of simple resource cards such as energies in Pokemon or lands in Magic where there isn't really any other icons or text to worry about obscuring and the image is simple enough that it won't matter so much. I know it would make all card games look exactly the same if they have an art frame, and the art is in the upper half of the card, and the name is above that, and maybe that chokes the market a lot by new games looking \\\"samey\\\" at a glance, but if you make your game have art to the edges, and card information on top of the art, it fatigues me mentally over time in a way that's not necessary, and I won't pick up those cards to play as often as I might have if I wasn't fatigued by just looking at them. The golden rule here should be \\\"Treat your art like any other image on your card. You wouldn't layer icons or make text run across them. Don't layer icons or text over images. Art is paramount.\\\" The image is just a bigger icon which is more unique from other icons so it can serve to identify the card at a glance. It should be respected as such. For example, the big green orb your game puts overlapping the base of the card art could have been a green bar that served as a bottom frame with a much smaller circle or diamond part at the middle of the line where your green orb is located. Small enough that it doesn't intrude visually on the image above or the information below, but wide enough as a bar to always be visible no matter where your thumb lands while holding it. Almost the width of the card. I'd actually recommend making this change in your own game's layout in future card sets if it's a persistent game, or later editions if it's a boxed card game. The big colorful circle is fun and whimsical at first glance, but it's also just a massive blank green field on the card that's wasting space and obscuring other elements. If it was white or black you'd see it for the wasted space it is as designed. It kind of feels like I had paint on my thumb when I was playing the game one time and now that smudge won't ever come off. Anyway, I wasn't trying to be too harsh, and I realize this is a lot of criticism in one of 3 comments on a video with 5 golden rules, so I want to end this one saying these observations aren't terrible. We all have our own methods and opinions. Take them or leave them, and don't let yourself dwell on what I've said here for more than it took to read the text unless you feel like you agree with what I said.

If you can't use the symbol (like asking on a text only forum or something) translating the set is far easier than translating the card name. A card named \\\"black knight\\\" in another language may not actually be called the equivalent in English (usually because a name may have unwanted connotations, like if a word or phrase could be considered rude in one language but not another).

And yes, I'm right handed. So anyway in conclusion idk if that rule which you said is actually true or not, honestly. I mean the rule sure but he using left vs right not that sure. Maybe I do it like that because in the card games I played the most (Yugioh and MTG) it's better to fan the cards like that? I legit have no clue I just know that it feels natural to do it this way and unnatural the other way and that makes me wonder if it's really true that mana values should be in left and not right... I mean in the kind of cards I want to make that doesn't really matters and I guess it's still better to use the top left if possible since we read left-right and top-down but yeah quite weird.\",\"@@brianbaker1700I think if the symbols represent a “thing”, and not a property, that may be something easier to understand. Like, if you see a picture of a rock, being used to stand for a rock, you can tell it is a rock.

The most important element - the card's attack and defense - was shown as small text under the card's effect\\u002fflavor text, which your opponent could not read from across the table. Meanwhile, the card's level, which only regularly came into play as a possible cost for summoning, was illustrated as a row of bright and colorful star orbs laid out under the card's name. Also, the art looked amateur. The colors and frames looked like someone slapped them together in Photoshop in under 10 minutes.

Neither keywording nor iconising are good ideas. They may make cards appear more readable at a glance, but when you actually try to read them for the sake of playing the game, keywording and iconising significantly reduce readability by requiring the player to reference the rulebook. There's a reason that MTG so strongly avoids doing either, using reminder text wherever font size allows and never adding a new icon that hasn't been a variation on the mana symbol (except for that one time they did the untap symbol for thematic reasons and then never did it again). Icons are especially bad because they break up the flow of a sentence - to be able to read the card, I have to learn how to pronounce your icons, and in many cases those icons' pronunciations aren't intuitive. \\\"read crossed swords as combat value\\\" is definitely not. The only time you can get away with icons is when the icons represent game objects, or maybe object properties, but that should still be done very sparingly, and it's a lot less likely to work in a card game than it is a board game.

I also prefer cards to be framed, and text or symbols overlapping art should be kept to an absolute minimum, if at all. In my opinion, Yu-Gi-Oh got it down perfectly when it comes to the art-to-information ratio, and its borders are perfect. Yes, they look like crap *now,* but that's only because they made the mistake of adding more and more complicated effects and thus having to shrink the font down to a size 6. If you revisit some of the classic Yu-Gi-Oh cards you may be pleasantly reminded of just how perfect the layout is.\",\"How- how long did this take?\",\"in moderate defense to having names of cards in the top left corner instead of costs, they can act as a really good information shortcut to really experienced players. as an MTG player, if I saw a fanned out hand of cards in a vacuum and see Counterspell in the top left corner of one of them, I've played the game enough to know exactly how much it costs and what it does just by seeing that name alone, in this case two blue mana. If I saw the cost in that position instead, it's certainly the most useful info I could know about the card while it hasn't yet been played, but (ignoring any other potential visual indicators for the sake of this example like seeing part of the art) I might not necessarily know *what* card it might be of that cost, for all I know the deck might be stacked with other cards that also cost two blue mana. however this only applies once you have played a game enough to tell what any card does just by the name or the art, this doesn't apply to new players which you should be probably be formatting the card's interface in service of. Not saying that the golden rule is straight up wrong or anything, just that if you are going to put something else there, I think the card name would be the second best alternative\",\"Never sit with you back to the door, my friend!\",\"There's a good form of this.

I feel like MTG does symbols really well: it has 7 recurring symbols (the 5 mana symbols, the colorless mana symbol, and the tap symbol), but all of these fall into categories (mana and tapping). The mana symbols don't take much memory space to tell them apart from each other because they're all the same size and shape, so really you have two symbols- mana symbols and tapping. 2 symbols is a lot easier to memorize than 5 or more, which is something I see in a lot of games nowadays. The symbols in MTG also don't come up when describing interactions between cards. MTG never uses the tap symbol to tell you that a card taps down an opposing creature, only to tell you to tap a card for an effect.\",\"@@The76532 KENTENSHI - paranoia\",\"Bro cook't\",\"ciao io ho messo like\",\"UNO😮😮😮\",\"Thx!\",\"Is it bold to say I liked this edit better than wano arc Luffy vs Kaido!!\",\"FAX BROS SPEAKING FAX\",\"​@@JohanLiebertkiGORND\",\"Facts 😂💯\",\"Frrrrr\",\"W\",\"@@snorristurluson5977 ?\",\"dang, he went there\",\"@@mariosalazar1828 wtf is that💀\",\"This is one of the best anime ever in my life!!!!❤❤\",\"I’m surprised you didn’t talk about the difference between yugioh cards and yugioh rush duel cards in how to improve a card’s design\",\"Hä\",\"Thats just how uno goes btw am your hundredth comment\",\"@@DreadXP-officaldidn’t ask\",\"@@rosdimohd1738 That aged well\",\"😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂\",\"​@@BRUHREALLY-sk6qw 🤖\",\"He really just drunk a coc is just mad crazy and animation is so good bro but the coc made me laugh to death😅😅\",\"IT WILL LITERALLY BE YUGIO VIBES AND MORE DRAMA\",\"Better than that beyblade flop\",\"True but it’s below average uno game with THE boys\",\"@@cacyk410346 seconds ago\",\"​@@SummoButBetter Paranoia if I'm correct\",\"yh\",\"🫥\",\"True😂😂😂😂\",\"Yes\",\"I've been working on my own card game and I'm finding all the details of it fascinating.

Which drugs are you using??\",\"Yeah, I agree with this one. In the video Dave said to \\\"keep the rules on the cards, not in a rule book\\\" or something to that effect, then also said to use symbols when text is repeated. The issue is that if the symbols aren't able to be defined on the card because using the symbol at all is meant to keep information concise, then you're offloading the explanation of the symbols to the rule book which is exactly contradictory to the other advice. The important thing is to consider how the information is conveyed. For example, A \\\"tap\\\" symbol like from Magic avoids needing to use the word \\\"tap\\\" or whatever word you use, in my game's case \\\"tax\\\". It's not that these words are very long. In fact the icon is only a few pixels shorter than the word written in the card's text. And when the card text says to \\\"tap target permanent\\\" or whatever in Magic it spells it out instead of using the icon. But the explanation for what this symbol means is entirely in the rule book. Why is this symbol necessary? The reason it's important is that you don't need to read it at all if it's a symbol, and it identifies it as a cost just like the mana costs. You just take it in at a glance, and you understand it to be a cost because other costs such as mana are in the same location on some cards. Why is mana a symbol? To be concise, yes, but it's more than that. It indexes them. They're all circles with different flavor shapes inside and unique colors from one another. The tap symbol is not mana, but it's also kept round and anyway you have to tap the lands to generate mana, so it's the same function just moved to the card itself. The most important amendment I'd make to the golden rule described in the video about when to use symbols is to use them whenever you would otherwise be repeating a key word, or key phrase, which is only slightly worded differently than the video itself but has a core meaning change. Remember that the reason is because the repeated phrase is important because it has depth that must be precise and universal. It's law. If it didn't need to be taken as law, it wouldn't need to be repeated in the exact same way every time and then fully explained in the rule book. The ability text that's written on a card is a contract, but a contract is just a paper covered in words until the court of law steps in to enforce it. Keywords are law themselves which contracts refer to for authority, and icons replacing keywords are done when the law needs to be identified as similar to one another and therefor indexed together in your mind, or when the keywords are too verbose like my comments. Red circle and blue circle are both indexed as mana in Magic, and mana is currency backed by law. Sometimes the mana symbol is there when it's provided, and sometimes removed. No need for the mana to have a + or - on it, though, because the contract outlines the terms like in all other contracts. Just know that the card has a purchase receipt in the top right corner which is always mana removed by using placement on the card as a language, and the card effect sections have a spot for mana removed as well at the start of the effect, and also for tapping in the same spot. If you find mana inside the text body, however, you need to refer to the rest of the effect contract to see how the law will apply this symbol. Also numbers are just symbols in language that have mathematical laws backing them as well. When you use numbers you're just using symbols who's rulebooks are taught thoroughly at school. 1 is an image that replaces the key word \\\"one\\\", just like 1\\u002f2 replaces \\\"one half\\\", but if you use them just right you can have your rulebook override some mathematical key words such as in Magic when 1\\u002f2 means \\\"1 power and 2 toughness\\\". This is another case of Magic using location as a form of language. 1 is a mathematical keyword that could be anywhere, but because of its location relative to the rest of the card and especially the \\u002f beside it this 1 also means \\\"power\\\" which is a separate keyword also defined in the rule book. Together these mean \\\"one power\\\", which is relevant to like 50 paragraphs of text for \\\"power\\\" in the completed rule book, and entire math degrees worth of information to fully define \\\"one\\\".

In the video Dave said to \\\"keep the rules on the cards, not in a rule book\\\" or something to that effect, then also said to use symbols when text is repeated. The issue is that if the symbols aren't able to be defined on the card because using the symbol at all is meant to keep information concise, then you're offloading the explanation of the symbols to the rule book which is exactly contradictory to the other advice. The important thing is to consider how the information is conveyed. For example, A \\\"tap\\\" symbol like from Magic avoids needing to use the word \\\"tap\\\" or whatever word you use, in my game's case \\\"tax\\\". It's not that these words are very long. In fact the icon is only a few pixels shorter than the word written in the card's text. And when the card text says to \\\"tap target permanent\\\" or whatever in Magic it spells it out instead of using the icon. But the explanation for what this symbol means is entirely in the rule book. Why is this symbol necessary? The reason it's important is that you don't need to read it at all if it's a symbol, and it identifies it as a cost just like the mana costs. You just take it in at a glance, and you understand it to be a cost because other costs such as mana are in the same location on some cards. Why is mana a symbol? To be concise, yes, but it's more than that. It indexes them. They're all circles with different flavor shapes inside and unique colors from one another. The tap symbol is not mana, but it's also kept round and anyway you have to tap the lands to generate mana, so it's the same function just moved to the card itself. The most important amendment I'd make to the golden rule described in the video about when to use symbols is to use them whenever you would otherwise be repeating a key word, or key phrase, which is only slightly worded differently than the video itself but has a core meaning change. Remember that the reason is because the repeated phrase is important because it has depth that must be precise and universal. It's law. If it didn't need to be taken as law, it wouldn't need to be repeated in the exact same way every time and then fully explained in the rule book. The ability text that's written on a card is a contract, but a contract is just a paper covered in words until the court of law steps in to enforce it. Keywords are law themselves which contracts refer to for authority, and icons replacing keywords are done when the law needs to be identified as similar to one another and therefor indexed together in your mind, or when the keywords are too verbose like my comments.

Also numbers are just symbols in language that have mathematical laws backing them as well. When you use numbers you're just using symbols who's rulebooks are taught thoroughly at school. 1 is an image that replaces the key word \\\"one\\\", just like 1\\u002f2 replaces \\\"one half\\\", but if you use them just right you can have your rulebook override some mathematical key words such as in Magic when 1\\u002f2 means \\\"1 power and 2 toughness\\\".

In starter product each keyword should have an (italics explanation) immediately following the keyword with the rest of the text continuing afterwards. This means that they can read the effect without compromising where in the lines of text they are. You don't want a book with keywords as when players get familiar with their kitchentop friends deck, they know what card they have in their hand when their friend starts rooting through the booklet. You may opt for two-three cards that exist in the players hand perpetually and can be shuffled into the hand that have the keywords and their explanations.

The item cards have the symbols in the text box, and the cost at the top.right corner, but the cost is for buying only (deckbuilder) so it's not needed after it's purchased and in the player's hand.

There's some tradeoffs compared to graphical symbols though; particularly I think graphical symbols stand out more and can stand out even in small spaces, but keywords can be more intuitive to read especially in terms of pronouncing a card out loud (like if trying to describe a card in Magic that has Haste, one just says \\\"it has haste\\\", but if it had some symbol like a person running or similar it might not be obvious how to say it without checking the rules). I think with a CCG the large potential card pool makes it make sense to have some priority on being able to pronounce text easily while that might not be necessary in the scope of a single board game.

Including it shouldn't make any legal difference. Denmark is like The Netherlands at the very top when it comes to English as a second language. This is largely due to tv with subtitles and of course the high use of internet. Tv doesn't get duped here except for some kids shows\\u002fmovies and the frankly horrible series shown on Disney-channel. You can easily show English youtube to pupils without much issues. It is something I've done a lot when teaching science, mostly to age 10-13. I agree that it is weird why the Netherlands doesn't just use the English version of games, instead of bothering with translation. I guess it's mostly because of nationalism, pride and tradition :). The Netherlands has triple the population compared to Denmark, so it is also a larger marked, but still relatively small. I personally would love the idea of Danish being slowly out phased, but English isn't a particular good language in its current form, being a mix of multiple languages explains the horrible connection between spelling and pronunciation of words. I agree that games can be simplified, but I think games like \\\"Monopoly\\\" would be a hard sell. You would remove a lot of the fun by changing the names to merely colours. The game is called Matador in Denmark and is from 1936. It is a slightly changed version of Monopoly, but has unmistakingly the same core gameplay. It has always used the same street names and is considered nothing less than a cult board game. Part of the fun is owning famous\\u002fhistorical streets, like getting \\\"Rådhuspladesen\\\" (AKA the town square in Copenhagen) it is something very special.

There's some tradeoffs compared to graphical symbols though; particularly I think graphical symbols stand out more and can stand out even in small spaces, but keywords can be more intuitive to read especially in terms of pronouncing a card out loud (like if trying to describe a card in Magic that has Haste, one just says \\\"it has haste\\\", but if it had some symbol like a person running or similar it might not be obvious how to say it without checking the rules). I think with a CCG the large potential card pool makes it make sense to have some priority on being able to pronounce text easily while that might not be necessary in the scope of a single board game. I wonder also if perhaps some particular kinds of gameplay elements are better suited to graphical representation while others work better textually.\",\"Yu-Gi-Oh but Yugi got tired of Monster Duels\",\"Dang\",\"​@@Thickest_boibros a nerd💀\",\"TRUE\",\"For real is a🥤😮😊😶 w edit\",\"Felicidades mi estimado caballero ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ esta bello la edicion 🎉🎉\",\"Best edit ever\",\"@@RyderPlaysOfficcalthats wild 😭\",\"..

Neither keywording nor iconising are good ideas. They may make cards appear more readable at a glance, but when you actually try to read them for the sake of playing the game, keywording and iconising significantly reduce readability by requiring the player to reference the rulebook. There's a reason that MTG so strongly avoids doing either, using reminder text wherever font size allows and never adding a new icon that hasn't been a variation on the mana symbol (except for that one time they did the untap symbol for thematic reasons and then never did it again). Icons are especially bad because they break up the flow of a sentence - to be able to read the card, I have to learn how to pronounce your icons, and in many cases those icons' pronunciations aren't intuitive. \\\"read crossed swords as combat value\\\" is definitely not. The only time you can get away with icons is when the icons represent game objects, or maybe object properties, but that should still be done very sparingly, and it's a lot less likely to work in a card game than it is a board game. Under no circumstances should an action ever be iconed.\",\"@brickmotionpictures1  let me fix this real quick 1 seconed alright here's the fixed version.

Symbols take a ton of memory space to learn since you have to connect them to words in your head anyway, and I get really turned off reading text with too many of them. I feel like MTG does symbols really well: it has 7 recurring symbols (the 5 mana symbols, the colorless mana symbol, and the tap symbol), but all of these fall into categories (mana and tapping). The mana symbols don't take much memory space to tell them apart from each other because they're all the same size and shape, so really you have two symbols- mana symbols and tapping. 2 symbols is a lot easier to memorize than 5 or more, which is something I see in a lot of games nowadays. The symbols in MTG also don't come up when describing interactions between cards. MTG never uses the tap symbol to tell you that a card taps down an opposing creature, only to tell you to tap a card for an effect.\",\"🤐☠️☠️🤯🥵🥶😈☠️🥇🎖️🏆📀🛑🛑🔇🔇\",\"a great example is M:tG has a gravestone symbol in a corner to indicate an ability that lets you play the card from the discard pile.\",\"I want to see the full story\",\"@@that_1_man18exactly😂\",\"@@Resurrectedcringecop attention seeker\",\"FRR HAHAHA\",\"​@@tenzobinju1481 that would be a cool edit to see ngl\",\"i think it's an underexaggeration of what goes on in Uno\",\"What app did you use to edit this?\",\"@@TheUnkGamerdisneyneed to pay its animators and actors\",\"fr\",\"​@@SummoButBetteractual song it's called \\\"anonymous girl A\\\"\",\"That is a mechanical skill we've all learned from playing the game.

Although they are long, the effects can be complex, and have a lot of specific limitations on when and how often they can be used. The latter is really what half of the text is. Terms and conditions. Additionally, in Asian language prints, they list out and give each effect a card has by a number, and reference each numbered effect whenever necessary. Also, makes it easy to know where one effect ends, and the other begins. All other languages, you have to read through a block of text, and deduce logically where each one ends, and each one begins. The Asian region is run and overseen by a different branch of Konami compared to the one in the West. So that is likely one reason why this format hasn't been moved over. One thing I actually would like to see get implemented. And keywords discourse I've found to be pretty touchy subject too within the community. Some players seem to loathe the idea because everything isn't spelled out directly to them, and increases the number of things new players need to learn, or something to those lines. When the game alreaady technically has 2 keywords that exist (Excavate and piercing). Adding in a few more to very specific actions that cannot have variations wouldn't be the end of the world. Although keywords in Yugioh in general is hard, since you can have like 6 different variations of a similar thing. Like in MTG, you have hexproof. It does one thing. While in Yugioh, you have cards that have similar abilities, but sometimes only for specific kinds of cards (Like only from Spells or only from monsters). You also have cards that are kind of reverse (Unaffected by anything that doesn't target it). At that point, it is probably easier to just be explicit with it at the cost of some real estate.\",\"@@bucketplayz43bro how about this🤓🖕\",\"no way to change your mind\",\"Why not just look at the card portrait image?

It keeps the image clear and unobscured by mechanical aspects of the game shown in text or icons. It means that when I'm looking at the art I'm looking at the art unobstructed and able to appreciate it fully, and when I'm looking for mechanical components I can find them where I know they will be without the colors and shapes of the art behind them distracting my eye and changing the color and shape language of the area around the game mechanic icon or text. I also care about my cards, and when a nick at the edge of a card damages a black or yellow, or white border or whatever, I don't care so much, but if it damages the edge of the card art I'm much more invested and bummed out by it. I can appreciate the odd full card art style from time to time, but I never use those cards, with the exception of simple resource cards such as energies in Pokemon or lands in Magic where there isn't really any other icons or text to worry about obscuring and the image is simple enough that it won't matter so much. I know it would make all card games look exactly the same if they have an art frame, and the art is in the upper half of the card, and the name is above that, and maybe that chokes the market a lot by new games looking \\\"samey\\\" at a glance, but if you make your game have art to the edges, and card information on top of the art, it fatigues me mentally over time in a way that's not necessary, and I won't pick up those cards to play as often as I might have if I wasn't fatigued by just looking at them. The golden rule here should be \\\"Treat your art like any other image on your card. You wouldn't layer icons or make text run across them. Don't layer icons or text over images. Art is paramount.\\\" The image is just a bigger icon which is more unique from other icons so it can serve to identify the card at a glance. It should be respected as such. For example, the big green orb your game puts overlapping the base of the card art could have been a green bar that served as a bottom frame with a much smaller circle or diamond part at the middle of the line where your green orb is located. Small enough that it doesn't intrude visually on the image above or the information below, but wide enough as a bar to always be visible no matter where your thumb lands while holding it. Almost the width of the card. I'd actually recommend making this change in your own game's layout in future card sets if it's a persistent game, or later editions if it's a boxed card game. The big colorful circle is fun and whimsical at first glance, but it's also just a massive blank green field on the card that's wasting space and obscuring other elements. If it was white or black you'd see it for the wasted space it is as designed. It kind of feels like I had paint on my thumb when I was playing the game one time and now that smudge won't ever come off. Anyway, I wasn't trying to be too harsh, and I realize this is a lot of criticism in one of 3 comments on a video with 5 golden rules, so I want to end this one saying these observations aren't terrible.

They only have a few symbols that they routinely use in the actual ability text: those for mana costs, and even then it’s used sparingly. People know how to read words, but they don’t come to your game knowing what your symbols mean in the context of your game. If you send them to the reference manual too many times to figure out what your symbols mean it’ll be frustrating.

If I saw the cost in that position instead, it's certainly the most useful info I could know about the card while it hasn't yet been played, but (ignoring any other potential visual indicators for the sake of this example like seeing part of the art) I might not necessarily know *what* card it might be of that cost, for all I know the deck might be stacked with other cards that also cost two blue mana. however this only applies once you have played a game enough to tell what any card does just by the name or the art, this doesn't apply to new players which you should be probably be formatting the card's interface in service of.

Even if I have an experienced player who can help me, is going to be very embarrassing and confusing to ask \\\"what does the little symbol that kinda looks like a question mark mean?\\\" On the other hand, if symbols *reinforce* an idea, then I 100% agree. In your game, I see the big green green in your card. So when the effect asks if the card below is [green gem], I immediately get what it means, even if \\\"green gem\\\" isn't the right term.

The only reason people watched was because of nostalgia. Also made gender discrimination and horrible animation. Marvel started to go haywire after endgame. They also made gender discrimination. Had horrible CGI. Had horrible writing(Thor,black widow etc.), Disney also f,cked up their own movies. Made gender discrimination. And also racism in the name of \\\"wokeness\\\" Marvel is the biggest franchise of all time Star wars is the second biggest Marvel became the biggest even before Disney then they bought it because it was big then they made a few more movies before going haywire Star wars was already big And you're telling me only a few people hate Disney?\",\"I like how in Terraforming Mars, the card abilities are written entirely in symbols, and they have a tiny explanation in words at the bottom. It's very easy to understand cards from across the table at a glance, and even if you can't, most cards are single use so there are only a few cards to memorize (and because of the huge iconography, it's memorization with a huge hint).\",\"real\",\"@@UnaTried and kinda\",\"Grazie a te\",\"W\",\"IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS\",\"THE ONE UNO\",\"Bro has a point\",\"As an autistic person; please only say it with fewer words if doing so doesn’t rely on a bunch of external context.

Including it shouldn't make any legal difference. Denmark is like The Netherlands at the very top when it comes to English as a second language. This is largely due to tv with subtitles and of course the high use of internet. Tv doesn't get duped here except for some kids shows\\u002fmovies and the frankly horrible series shown on Disney-channel. You can easily show English youtube to pupils without much issues. It is something I've done a lot when teaching science, mostly to age 10-13. I agree that it is weird why the Netherlands doesn't just use the English version of games, instead of bothering with translation. I guess it's mostly because of nationalism, pride and tradition :). The Netherlands has triple the population compared to Denmark, so it is also a larger marked, but still relatively small. I personally would love the idea of Danish being slowly out phased, but English isn't a particular good language in its current form, being a mix of multiple languages explains the horrible connection between spelling and pronunciation of words. I agree that games can be simplified, but I think games like \\\"Monopoly\\\" would be a hard sell. You would remove a lot of the fun by changing the names to merely colours. The game is called Matador in Denmark and is from 1936. It is a slightly changed version of Monopoly, but has unmistakingly the same core gameplay. It has always used the same street names and is considered nothing less than a cult board game. Part of the fun is owning famous\\u002fhistorical streets, like getting \\\"Rådhuspladesen\\\" (AKA the town square in Copenhagen) it is something very special. The name adds to the experience. @@borstenpinsel\",\"Bro dropped the hardest edit in existence, then dipped 😂\",\"TRUE\",\"@@imeldaenysurayaramlan4221 yes💀💀\",\"Uno: The Anime Edition 😂😂 The only card game that can rival Yugioh in its prime\",\"Bro, I wanna be an epic editor and make edits like yours.

And yes, I'm right handed. So anyway in conclusion idk if that rule which you said is actually true or not, honestly. I mean the rule sure but he using left vs right not that sure. Maybe I do it like that because in the card games I played the most (Yugioh and MTG) it's better to fan the cards like that? I legit have no clue I just know that it feels natural to do it this way and unnatural the other way and that makes me wonder if it's really true that mana values should be in left and not right...

Although they are long, the effects can be complex, and have a lot of specific limitations on when and how often they can be used. The latter is really what half of the text is. Terms and conditions. Additionally, in Asian language prints, they list out and give each effect a card has by a number, and reference each numbered effect whenever necessary. Also, makes it easy to know where one effect ends, and the other begins. All other languages, you have to read through a block of text, and deduce logically where each one ends, and each one begins. The Asian region is run and overseen by a different branch of Konami compared to the one in the West. So that is likely one reason why this format hasn't been moved over. One thing I actually would like to see get implemented. And keywords discourse I've found to be pretty touchy subject too within the community. Some players seem to loathe the idea because everything isn't spelled out directly to them, and increases the number of things new players need to learn, or something to those lines. When the game alreaady technically has 2 keywords that exist (Excavate and piercing). Adding in a few more to very specific actions that cannot have variations wouldn't be the end of the world. Although keywords in Yugioh in general is hard, since you can have like 6 different variations of a similar thing. Like in MTG, you have hexproof. It does one thing. While in Yugioh, you have cards that have similar abilities, but sometimes only for specific kinds of cards (Like only from Spells or only from monsters). You also have cards that are kind of reverse (Unaffected by anything that doesn't target it). At that point, it is probably easier to just be explicit with it at the cost of some real estate.\",\"@@Play-In-Games I feel like it's a relatively safe bet that a French publisher at the time would be pro Catholic, especially given that their use of Christian iconography.

To get around this they have a sub-rule: if you have space to explain the thing, explain the thing. This most commonly occurs with set-specific keywords like Soulbond. What does Soulbond do? Well I can look at my Wingcrafter (which is a common card) and everything I need to know about the keyword is right there. Now when I get a rare or mythic card that JUST has the keyword I already know what it does. So one variation of your card could read: Gain one colourless power shard (colourless power shard symbol). If the card below this one is (green), this card has a combat value (sword) of 1.\",\"cool\",\"@@Allyourbusinessokay shut up please you bots are so annoying\",\"@@Iusethis4commentsthe latter\",\"what editing app do you use and how the actual fu..\",\"Grande Jackkkkkk\",\"2867 likes and 12 replies?

During your opponent's turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 Monster Card treated as a Continuous Spell on the field; Special Summon it to your field. If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Special Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY. You can only use each effect of \\\"Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon\\\" once per turn. | But if the cards didn't explain all their rulings in the text and only said the most important parts (losing the nuance) a revised friendly version would read like: - Place 1 face-up monster on the field or GY, in its owner's Backrow as a Continuous Spell. - During your opponent's turn (Instant): You can Summon monster treated as a continuous spell to your field. - If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY.

For one of them, I'm trying to replace every single line of text in the dungeon crawling cards with symbols, and even if it's easy to read if you know what the symbols mean, it will probably be overwhelming for the new players and I will probably need to make a full document explaining each card (but it wont be included in the game, just a link to access it). The item cards have the symbols in the text box, and the cost at the top.right corner, but the cost is for buying only (deckbuilder) so it's not needed after it's purchased and in the player's hand. The second game has 11 spaces for icons at the right side of the cards, which are present in all cards regardless of type. The icons on those spaces vary depending on the type, but the general theme of the icons share the same spot. I'm still working on the design, tho, but the idea is fine i think, I just need it to look more professional.\",\"Your editing skills are *impeccable!*\",\"Hardest beat in my life\",\"Fatalità un

so much as that Gangar card is literal eye cancer. As for the Magic Card, sure there's some minor merit to your Rule 1, but it's *very* minor. As you say later, the cards in your hand are indeed the cards you put into your deck, so you don't need the mana cost visible all the time while you have things tightly fanned. People have object permanence and minor memory capacities. They can see the mana cost (and other info) and then remember it for most cards even when it's obscured. Furthermore, The mana cost being on the left side under the name of Tarmogoyf now causes two problems. First is that it's obscuring the picture, and the picture is the most important thing because - again - people remember the info on their own cards. They just need to recognize which card they have, and that mana cost there is obscuring the image if there are similar 1-F green cards. Two, the beauty of Magic cards is that everything is placed in its own relevant space, so you can find the information you want about the card by looking at a distinct section of it. name, image, mana cost, creature type, power\\u002ftoughness, effects (and sometimes flavor text). They're partitioned out so everything is clear and the info for one section doesn't distract from info in another section. This puts the mana cost and the name in the same spot, and makes the mana cost unclear because of the curved behavior. This works for something that costs some colorless mana and a single colored mana, but what if it cost 3 forests? 5 forests? Now the mana cost design has to curve around and make the spacing uneven and make counting harder. So your format is either going to suck for some cards, or you're going to only use this format for cards with few colored mana, making a split standard which makes it that much worse to look at cards and evaluate their information at a glance. Because now you need to look in two different locations with two different formats for mana cost. Which is why that Gangar card is such cancer. The image now covers the whole damn thing, being distracting in general and making reading any of the text a nightmare. Well defined borders and information is important. And no, it doesn't have to be \\\"most to least important, top to bottom\\\" like some kind of passage in a book. The important thing is that relevant information is visible, and in its own space so you can instantly fixate on whatever information is most Sorry but, while this video was nicely produced, you're speaking like these design rules are gospel. And that'd be fine if they were fundamental and ironclad but, frankly, they're arbitrary, poorly supported, and often missing what's important. You're not arranging text on a page or trying to tell a whole cards story from the 10% visible in a tightly fanned hand.

I use to take $10 (which was reasonable amount back in 1979) if I lost it..., I went home. We played a version called 7's up, only the 7 cards up were used and the disk cards were shuffled back into the deck. ..., except one night (our hosts 30th birthday party) our host wanted to include a joker as a wild card. Night was going good..., 5 of us playing..., the bets kept going up and up till there was just me and the host left. He kept showing his cards to the guys behind him..., and kept upping the bet, to the point I \\\"HAD\\\" to stop him..., he had bet his entire fortnights wage, which was close enough to $400 (he was married with a new born baby) even threatening to bet me my car against his (I had a Valiant Charger, he had a custom Ford build). The thing was \\\"I KNEW\\\" it was impossible for me to loose and refused to take his bet. In the end I decided enough was enough and called him..., he super proudly and believing he had a winning hand laid down 4 aces..., the look soon turned to horror when I laid down 5 jacks..., the irony is I got the joker on the second group of cards. I had to give him back $20 so he could buy baby formula to feed his kid (no ATM's in those day's). He was forever greatful that I knocked back the car bet...., hopefully he learnt his lesson. 😊\",\"E quel momento del anno che succede!!!\",\"My hat is off to you\",\"Very acurate\",\"NICE EAIT\",\"This is a fantastic video, well done Simone!\",\"I thought poker was a card game for the members of the harem\",\"what was the first game played with these playing cards?\",\"@@neveryknow uno is like this at game night with all genders.\",\"I agree a lot.

Era un gioco bellissimo e molto avvincente, si poteva giocare in 3-4 o 5 giocatori, ognuno per proprio conto senza accoppiamenti. La sostanza del gioco era che si dovevano chiudere le otto carte pescando o dal tallone o dallo scarto del giocatore che precedeva. Con la possibilità di rinunciare a pescare e \\\"battere\\\" pagando 1, 2 o 3 punti. Gli altri giocatori pagavano tutte le carte non sistemate a combinazioni di tre, quattro o più carte. Se si chiudevano tutte le otto carte si aveva diritto a togliere -10 punti dal proprio punteggio mentre gli altri pagavano sempre le carte non \\\"sistemate\\\" come detto sopra. Il gioco finiva quando un solo giocatore rimaneva con un punteggio inferiore 71 punti. Il gioco finiva anche quando un giocatore sistemava tutte le otto carte secondo una scala reale o una combinazione di otto carte uguali (otto 2, otto 3, otto 4... etc.) Queste ultime 2 combinazioni si pagavano con il doppio o il triplo della posta. Vi assicuro che ci si divertiva tantissimo a prescindere dal valore della posta e sopratutto era un gioco che richiedeva la max concentrazione perchè poi c'erano diverse altre regole che impedivano e punivano ogni distrazione...

The standard deck of our cards has 36 cards: 6, 7, 8, 9, Banner (which basically functions as the 10), Under (which means subordinate and is equivalent to the Jack), Ober (which means something like lord and replaces the queen), König (the King) and Ass (yeah, that‘s how we call the ace😅).\",\"I began to play poker on discord and discovered a game full of mysticism, variance but strategy.

If fifty-two cards to a deck and fifty-two weeks to a year, there must be some way to make it work out to find the date, right? – Here’s how. You have to first remember this order of suits: Spade, Diamond, Club, Heart. Knowing this order will note each week of the month as Week-1, Week-2, Week-3, and Week-4. So, for January 1st, it would strictly be the Ace of Spades, and the same card will be used to note the top of the first week in the order of weeks following a second card that marks the day(not weekday) of that week. So by placing a four of any suit, you mark yourself on a picture frame that it is the “fourth day of the first week” of January being January 4th. This methodology works only by using up to the number 7 card. Because by following the order, on the 8th you will replace the initial week card to the Ace of Diamonds, and it represents the 8th of January by its sole self. You then use the cards 2-7 to mark the day of the days of week as they progress through. You have to note that when changing the Week card in following this order, the cards themselves to the number of that month will only represent the 1st, the 8th, the 15th, and the 22nd. The second card, being any suit 2-7, represents the numbered day within that week. When you get to the end of the week, you can only get to a maximum of the 28th. After that, respective of the same order reveals a pattern where you can use the Kings for the 29th, 30th, and 31st. – So, a Four of Hearts with a King of Diamonds means it would be the 30th of April. And then the following day becomes the Five of Spades, noting the first of May. There’s been a third card adding to the collective of two cards during this period. Another set of 1-7 cards used to represent the day of the week. Not much of this has been mentioned, but there’s speculation as to what day begins the day of the week: M-1, T-2, W-3, Th-4, F-5, Sa-6, Su-7. There’s nothing stopping you from setting apart a specific suit for noting this function from the aforementioned perspective. Perhaps you use a picture frame and stick the second card behind the Week Counter card, and use a Joker in front of the weekday card. This is what I found that works.\",\"Yep\\u002fyea\",\"I have always been taught that the game is to 120 as that is the total of all the points in the deck. and played 3 out of three to win.

Looking at regular playing cards (like poker cards), while some cards have the name on all 4 corners, a lot of the biggest brands (like Bicycle) have the name of the card only on the top-left and bottom-right. It seems to be generally accepted as a common practice to fan cards with the top-left corner visible. And the only peoples I've met that complained about it were left-handed, so maybe there is something about the majority of right-handed peoples finding it easier to fan that way while the majority of left-handed peoples finding it easier to fan the other way. As for my own experience, I'm right-handed, and I hold card with my left-hand so that I can play with my right hand. While with two hands I can fan both ways, if I try to fan only with my left hand (and I do one-handed fanning most of the time), it's much easier for me to fan to show the top-left corner.

For every second that passes this person is going through one new permutation. The other person, meanwhile, takes one step over 1 million years. Two steps, two million years, etc. This person does this until they've circumnavigated the entire planet. Once them get back to where they started, they then take one drop of water out of the ocean. One million more years, one more step, one more trip around the world, and they take a second drop of water out of the ocean. They do this until there is no water left in the ocean. Once it's dry, they then take a piece of paper and place it on the ground. One more step, one more pass around the world, and then they put one drop of water back in the ocean. This is done until it is full again. A second piece of paper. This process keeps happening until this stack of paper reaches the sun.... 3000 times. Once that last piece of paper has touched the sun, only then will the first person have finished shuffling that deck of cards and will have seen every permutation of cards.\",\"Cazzo tante\",\"​tg Fenham @@ZachXFire79\",\"Your work lives up to your name\",\"Thanks for the video nice job explaning the game 😂\",\"I almost idi man\",\"What an EDIT\",\"Daje bro la prossima metti solo quelli nuovi sennò ti esplode casa\",\"good video\",\"aaaaaaaaaaa bro stop aaaaaaa mamaamammama aaaaaaaaaaaaa brrrrrrro aaaa\",\"​@ThatchairinthecommentsOmg that chair in the comments!\",\"bro compare cartoons and live action movies💀\",\"@@AngelusNielson That's true, I have my fair share of plains cards...

Looking at regular playing cards (like poker cards), while some cards have the name on all 4 corners, a lot of the biggest brands (like Bicycle) have the name of the card only on the top-left and bottom-right. It seems to be generally accepted as a common practice to fan cards with the top-left corner visible. And the only peoples I've met that complained about it were left-handed, so maybe there is something about the majority of right-handed peoples finding it easier to fan that way while the majority of left-handed peoples finding it easier to fan the other way. As for my own experience, I'm right-handed, and I hold card with my left-hand so that I can play with my right hand. While with two hands I can fan both ways, if I try to fan only with my left hand (and I do one-handed fanning most of the time), it's much easier for me to fan to show the top-left corner. I can do it with one sweep of my big thumb, while I need multiple tries and\\u002for some helps from my other fingers to fan the other way.\",\"Ogni anno ho sempre più paura che jack sia sommerso da mazzi di carte Non oso pensare al prossimo anno\",\"im pretty sure its the episode when he is inside of gary, and he gets thirsty during the fall, so he drinks a soda\",\"Fun but modern idea.

Knowing when to use graphics and when to just leave it streamlined is a huge thing for card design. In my experience the most important information is: What kind of card is it When can i use it (instant vs sorcery) What and how much resources does it use What it actually does.

First, playing cards are based on dominoes (and dominoes are based on dice), after that they made money cards, Chinese Cards deck had 4 suits, coins, strings, 10k, and miriads(4th was miriads), they droped miridas when they created mahjong. Value in the corner of the card is appered just in XIX century, check your info more closely\",\"A few corrections and elaborations: 1. Japan didn't get playing cards from China, instead it was Portuguese missionaries and traders who brought cards with them. They were then declared illegal and only criminals would play with them. Hanafuda was actually created as a way to play cards without using what looks like actual playing cards. Nintendo started as a cardmaking company. 2. Italian cards, much like spanish cards, don't really have a queen, instead they have a cavalryman. The queens appear of course in italian tarot decks. 3. Tarot was actually created for card games too! The major arcana were originally the suit of triumphs (it. trionfi), which appropriately triumphs over the other four suits. From this word we get the english word \\\"trump\\\" and german \\\"Trumpf\\\". In france, the game of french tarot is the second most popular traditional card game. Tarot de Marseilles is still made with card play in mind under the name of \\\"tarocco piemontese\\\" in Italy. Tarocco Bolognese is still alive and well in Bologna. 4. The Swiss have their own set of suits also! The swiss suits are a variant of german suits, where leaves are replaced by shields and hearts by roses. These cards are usually called Jasskarte because they're predominantly used to play games of the jass family (like clobyosh or belote, though swiss jasses form a whole sub-family of their own), and to the point that games that are not jasses but are played with these cards are called jass too, e.g. Kaiserjass aka Kaiserspiel (which is a direct descendant of the oldest known european game, Karnöffel) 5. Rank and suit indices are actually a fairly recent addition! A lot of italian latin-suited (and even french-suited) regional decks, which generally are pretty old patterns, have no indices.\",\"A Royal Flush is a Straight Flush just the highest one available.

In fact, it allows a fine grain hierarchy on the power level, even when there are effects that manipulate those stats. For example, a monster with 2450 atk is stronger than a 2400 but weaker than a 2500. And even if an effect halves their atk, the monster has 1225 atk, wich keeps it stronger than the 1200 and weaker than the 1250. If there were only 2 digits, all three would have 12 atk, removing the power hierarchy on them. Also, there are archetypes that can take advantage of halving your life points. If you have 8000 life points, you can half them 12 times (keeping 1 LP). If you had only 2 digits, you could only half 6 times your 80 LP.\",\"@@gaminmations7697 it’s not better\",\"Mamma mia quanto vorrei avere anche solo un decimo di quel tappeto ahaha\",\"Tra 20 anni: home tour del mio nuovo castello di carte\",\"@@Typewriters875 glad to know I had an inpact on someone for once in YouTube comments\",\"AND I WANT MORE!\",\"Sempre io che ho in tutto 2 mazzi di carte: ok Jack scusa, hai vinto tu. 😂😂\",\"Exactly\",\"@@LibertyMonk The \\\"Art is Paramount\\\" in my opinion helps MtG get away with it. There are a handful of cards I don't know the name of in my deck but I know their art and the art of these cards is easier to see upside-down (as the opponent) so I tend to focus more on the art of the card and recognise it rather than trying to see the name. And besides that, the name isn't really important. The cost, power\\u002ftoughness and effect are easily more relevant than the name and those can be seen by fanning it displaying top right. In my country at least, nearly all playing card brands display information in all 4 corners. If you asked me to name every card in even my most played MtG deck off the top of my head I couldn't. I could survive with having the names blacked out for every card as I recognised their art, the combination of costs and effects. Obviously, when learning the alternate arts and new sets, names are important but in my opinion, art, cost and power\\u002ftoughness make all spells far more recognisable than name. This may differ from other peoples experiences and card games but that's why I think MtG gets away with it.\",\"I’m loving these videos!

There is also a read\\u002fwrite head that can move across the tape. There's other details that are too long (check Wikipedia), but it's basically that a Turing Machine only requires the head to follow a finite series of instructions (e.g. a program) to write and read. It would be trivially easy to chose a representation of 0 (blank) and 1 on a deck of cards (e.g. A-7 = 0, 8-K = 1) and then create a game with rules that mimic Turing Complete operations. The human player would operate as the tape head. Even Turing himself conceived of the original tape this way, with the head being someone literally following a rote set of instructions. @satibel is more or less correct, and even includes memory registers for a display. The limitation of 52 cards isn't actually an issue, because \\\"this is a Turing Machine barring memory limitations\\\" is always a caveat for IRL Turing Machines, as the mathematical one can have infinite memory.

As for the Magic Card, sure there's some minor merit to your Rule 1, but it's *very* minor. As you say later, the cards in your hand are indeed the cards you put into your deck, so you don't need the mana cost visible all the time while you have things tightly fanned. People have object permanence and minor memory capacities. They can see the mana cost (and other info) and then remember it for most cards even when it's obscured. Furthermore, The mana cost being on the left side under the name of Tarmogoyf now causes two problems. First is that it's obscuring the picture, and the picture is the most important thing because - again - people remember the info on their own cards. They just need to recognize which card they have, and that mana cost there is obscuring the image if there are similar 1-F green cards. Two, the beauty of Magic cards is that everything is placed in its own relevant space, so you can find the information you want about the card by looking at a distinct section of it. name, image, mana cost, creature type, power\\u002ftoughness, effects (and sometimes flavor text). They're partitioned out so everything is clear and the info for one section doesn't distract from info in another section. This puts the mana cost and the name in the same spot, and makes the mana cost unclear because of the curved behavior. This works for something that costs some colorless mana and a single colored mana, but what if it cost 3 forests? 5 forests? Now the mana cost design has to curve around and make the spacing uneven and make counting harder. So your format is either going to suck for some cards, or you're going to only use this format for cards with few colored mana, making a split standard which makes it that much worse to look at cards and evaluate their information at a glance. Because now you need to look in two different locations with two different formats for mana cost. Which is why that Gangar card is such cancer. The image now covers the whole damn thing, being distracting in general and making reading any of the text a nightmare. Well defined borders and information is important. And no, it doesn't have to be \\\"most to least important, top to bottom\\\" like some kind of passage in a book. The important thing is that relevant information is visible, and in its own space so you can instantly fixate on whatever information is most Sorry but, while this video was nicely produced, you're speaking like these design rules are gospel. And that'd be fine if they were fundamental and ironclad but, frankly, they're arbitrary, poorly supported, and often missing what's important. You're not arranging text on a page or trying to tell a whole cards story from the 10% visible in a tightly fanned hand. You want each card, individually, to have its information clear, organized, identifiable, and recognizable. Absolute location doesn't matter as much as being distinct. People's memory takes care of the rest. And because it's so bad, I have to say it a third time. That Gangar card was cancer and you ought to be ashamed for holding that up as some kind of implication that players \\\"just don't know what's good for them.\\\"\",\"😢😢\",\"È bellissimo questo video\",\"Nessuno: Jack tra 10 anni: \\\"bene raga, dopo 2 ore di video vi ho fatto vedere tutta la collezione\\\"\",\"Yeah but according to UNO YOU CANT FUCJING STACK +2 CARDS ONTOP OF EACHOTHER NOR CAN YOU DO THAT WITH +4 CARDS\",\"@@LOL10076 It is true\",\"20:46 - Jack, \\\"Monkey king\\\" sono le carte della leggenda dello scimmiotto giapponese da cui venne tratto il manga di Dragonball e tanti altri film e anime che abbiamo visto molti di noi!\",\"Come ogni anno spacchi❤️\",\"Single handedly written, directed, and yes… EDITED by yours truly, Legendary Jay.

Notably, a deck of cards does not have rules to change that deck by, so it is not Turing Complete. Magic the Gathering is a set of rules combined with playing cards which can act as the counters, that's why it's Turing Complete, because through its cards + rules you can have infinite loops i.e. infinite counters\",\"Nothing to do with Texas hold-em\",\"Fr😅\",\"Except in the real rules, that doesn't work.

Sure, maybe the design, but for a very long time there was no jokers in most card games. There's a family of card games using the tarot cards, the tarok games. They are very old games of european origin. They have special rules for The Fool card, so you could say that it was the first joker. But for the rest of the games? Karnoffel didn't use them, Piquet doesn't, Skat doesn't, Whist doesn't. Euchre was one of the first modern games to use them, being designated as the second-highest and highest cards of the trump suit. If anything, the major arcana inspired the trump suits in modern games! Before Whist (that's around 17th century I believe?), there was no trumps in most card games. Again, only Tarok had it. And it was the major arcana that was trump! One evidence of that being the case is the card game Piquet, created during the lifetime (maybe a little more) of Jeanne d'Arc, 15th century. No trumps there, all suits equal. And a bit of personal opinion: Piquet is a difficult game, hard to do the hand estimations there.

The design of magic cards is so well made for speed-reading a card and giving you all the information you need in a glance. Magic is like the street fighter of card games, and the fact that the design of the cards has not changed much is a sign of how well designed are they. Not perfect, but clearly effective. Considering you are playing, that you know the cards in your deck, and that you are thinking about the gameplay rather than the visuals: Name being on top, cost and power being in the same side means you can hold 7 cards in your hand have all the relevant information to know what cards you have just with 10% of the actual cards visible. By revealing 10 % more of the card, you may recognize the art, and you only need to fully see the card if you need to read the text, which is often keyworded for speed. A full read of the card is only needed once when you draw the card, where its all visible anyway, or as a quick reminder while playing. I've always held cards in my hand in a way this is obvious. You just need to fan the cards the other way. As a designer, when you see a flaw on the top dogs, you need to ask yourself whether or not you are the one making a mistake, and analyse why that mistake is there, rather than thinking \\\"its old, they didnt know any better, and players dont want it to change because they are dumb\\\".

There are a handful of cards I don't know the name of in my deck but I know their art and the art of these cards is easier to see upside-down (as the opponent) so I tend to focus more on the art of the card and recognise it rather than trying to see the name. And besides that, the name isn't really important. The cost, power\\u002ftoughness and effect are easily more relevant than the name and those can be seen by fanning it displaying top right. In my country at least, nearly all playing card brands display information in all 4 corners. If you asked me to name every card in even my most played MtG deck off the top of my head I couldn't. I could survive with having the names blacked out for every card as I recognised their art, the combination of costs and effects. Obviously, when learning the alternate arts and new sets, names are important but in my opinion, art, cost and power\\u002ftoughness make all spells far more recognisable than name.

However, I have to ask... have you tried fanning the cards in the other direction?\",\"It is a feature most people won't need or use and can potentially be conceived as non-essential clutter, why it shouldn't be a golden rule. But I do agree, that it at the very least should be a consideration during the design phase. If used it should only be placed in non-intrusive place so it doesn't shift focus. This rules out the corner of a card as an option, but something like faded text integrated to the bottom of a picture or perhaps at the bottom of the card itself are more valid options. The latter is what MTG use now, apparently called \\\"collection number\\\". I'm not a fan of it because it is ugly - but it is fine, I guess. Not something I have any use for. There can be some gains. Like in games where the number is integral to the game mechanics (e.g. Bang! where a number\\u002fsuit can blow you up or save you from being shot), or games where additional rules often is needed (makes for faster rulebook index). Looking up a number is definitely faster than names\\u002fwords. It doesn't matter in simple games (e.g. Settlers of Catan, where all cards are numbered) and where a little extra clutter won't make much difference. OT: Getting increasingly annoyed of all the different languages of games. You can relatively easily get hold of the German, French or Dutch version of games like Oriflamme here in the EU, but you'll often need to double or triple the cost to import a proper English\\u002finternational version. Games are already expensive enough to get hold on here in Denmark... I guess some of it is down to copyrights laws, etc. Mass production of English versions would be nice :) @@gaijinco\",\"1:10 Huh.

It is a variation of the much more famous game Scopa, and it is played with the 40 card italian deck (you can also play with the french standard deck using only the first seven cards per suit and the figure cards). It is called Ruspo. To learn Ruspo you first have to learn Scopa, wich is played as follows (the game can be played in 4 or in 2, but I will teach how to play for two players): HOW TO PLAY SCOPA The game starts by dealing three cards to the players and putting four cards on the table. The card values are as follows: The first seven cards of each suit are worth face values, the Jack is worth 8, the Horse (in Italy it's called Horse not Knight) or Queen is worth 9, and the King is worth 10. In turns, starting with the player that DIDN'T deal the cards, the players play cards and take cards from the table of equal value to the card they played. For example, the first player plays a king, in the table there is 2, 7, 3, 4; so the player that played the king will take the 3, the 7 and the king they played, wich =10, and will put the card in front of them face down (if instead of 2, 7, 3, 4 there was 2, 7, king, 3 the player that played the king would have directly taken the king). It is now the other player's turn. If a player doesn't have anything to take, they simply play a card on the table. This continues until the players don't have any more cards in their hands, so the dealer will deal three more cards to the players. If a player in a given moment plays a card and takes every card on the table (for example: 2 and 4 on the table and the player plays 6) they say \\\"scopa\\\" and marks it with a face up card on their deck of cards they took. On the last round, wich is when there are no more cards to deal and the players have their last three cards, when all players don't have any more cards to play the cards on the table get taken by the last person that took cards from the table. The game is over, and now it's time to assing the points. You gain a point by: - each scopa you did - If you have Re Bello (King of coins or King of diamonds) - If you have Settebello (Seven of coins or seven of diamonds) - If you have more cards than the opponent, if it's a tie no one gains this point - If you have more sevens than the opponent, if they tie you count the six, and if they also are tied this point isn't counted - If you have more coins or diamonds that the opponent, if they tie this point isn't counted The first to arrive to 21 points wins, if both players arrive at 21, they continue playing until one wins more points at the end of a match. HOW TO PLAY RUSPO (IN MY OPINION THE BETTER VERSION) The game is played like scopa, and the points at the end of the match are counted in the same way, but there are this changes: If on the first four cards on the table an Ace shows up, you put another card on the table, put the Ace in the deck and shuffle it. Instead of taking by playing a card face up, you take by playing a card face down, so this allows the players to cheat (for example, there is a 7 on the table, the player cheats by playing a 6 face down and takes the 7). Of course, the players can also take with the correct card, but they still have to play it face down. The player that didn't play can doubt what the other player did before them: if they doubt the cards that have been taken on the turn before are revealed, if the player that played the cards played correctly, they keep the cards and mark a scopa, if they cheated, they put the cards they took on that turn on the table and the opponent marks a scopa. The opponent has to doubt the other player's action before he plays a card, if it was the last card, before they see the new cards. The Aces are special cards: the player can play an Ace face down and say \\\"ruspo\\\" then take all the cards on the table, even if there aren't any; taking all the cards with an Ace does not mark a scopa. Clearly, the player can do a ruspo with every card, not just an Ace, as long as the opponent doesn't doubt; if they doubt, the mechanism explained before is applied. If the player can't or doesn't want to take they can also choose to play a card on the table like normal. The point at the end are counted the same way as Scopa, the first to arrive to 41 points wins.\",\"Gojo, Saitama, and Goku's power no holding back combined cannot compare.\",\"@@LinoPlayz-p8d holy goldfish attention span\",\"sei forte jack \\u003c3\",\"If zachtronics made a solitare game, knowing nothing else about it except that its a zachtronics game removes any of the judgement that you are anticipating from me.

The seven books of the Apocrypha\\u002fDeuterocanon were not recognised by all Catholics prior to the Reformation, and hence were not part of the canon. (Hence the name Deuterocanon - literally, second canon - adopted by the RC Church.) The RC Church unilaterally made these books canonical after the Reformation at the Council of Trent. Several doctrines and dogmas of the RC Church, such as purgatory, rely heavily on these books which Protestants do not believe Divinely inspired. Protestants do not deprecate these books: they have a high regard for them. So highly are they regarded, that in English Bibles it was common for them to be printed in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments, right through to the 19th century. Personally I think they should still be printed there, although I can understand the reasoning of those who take the opposite view. Two final points: first, Martin Luther did not determine the books of the Protestant Bible, there were a multitude of Reformers who reached a consensus; and second, your opinion that somehow the Protestant Bibles use corrupted texts is erroneous. The King James Bible, the most famous of them, is arguably the first \\\"modern\\\" Bible in the western world, based on extensive scholarship, providing a synthesis of all original manuscripts available at that time. From a scholarly point of view, although the beauty of its language remains unequalled, it has since been superceded by new translations (based on academic advances and older manuscripts that have become available over the last 400 years, which were unknown to the original translators).\",\"Another fantastic video marred only by Simone's categorically incorrect pronunciation of Balatro.\",\"jack anch'io vorrei avere una collezione come la tua e la sto iniziando però ho solo otto mazzi .

I was taught this game by my Sicilian grandfather as a very young child. We played it all the time when I was a young girl. Since then, he’s passed, and I no longer have anyone to ask in my family that recalls how to play! So now I’m a mother of 4 kids and I’ve always wanted to share this with them. Nothing I searched in google came up with any results. I’m sooo excited happy to have come across this video, because I was searching by the wrong word! My grandfather used to say “Gotcha!”- or however you’d spell the word that sounds like “doo-weetie”, which is clearly “to vitti”. (You can understand how a little kid might misunderstand the pronunciation of a word, especially a language she’s not used to.) And google translate for “Gotcha” is “preso”, which I knew for sure it wasn’t called that! So when I watched this video, and heard you pronounce it the way you did, I got a good laugh at my child version of myself misunderstanding what my grandfather EVERY TIME he said “ti vitti” for “doo-weetie”, and was THRILLED to FINALLY find the correct spelling and the game I’ve been searching for for years!

How come you know all this?\",\"One thing most cards are missing (which is weird because regular playing cards have that) is an index. In most games you still hold your cards fanned in your hand. You just can't see ANY info. Sometimes the background is different, giving you some information (like a type or something in MtG). But that's it. Hearthstone gets away with it, because they assist with highlighted borders. A card that can be played is green. A card that targets a minion can't be played with no minions on the field, even if the cost is within your current budget. A card that has a special effect gets a yellow border. Often this border appears when an effect occurs like \\\"look, your opponent played a type-X minion. This card has a bonus that just activated\\\". That's a luxury that non-virtual games don't have. IF I have a card in my hand that is strong against the undead, I want to see it at one glance. If a card has a combo effect, I want to see it at one glance, so I can plan my move). Not many games even have this kind of info as an icon (hearthstone does in a limited form with icons for special effects, death cry etc - on the bottom of the card). In many games you need to read the text to get an idea what this card is about. If you translate the text to klingon, a water type with a kombo effect is indistinguishable from a fire type with a permanent buff during certain conditions). That makes it very hard for new players to enter the game and makes strategizing a long process. The more cards you have, the worse it gets.\",\"Bro turned this short into dragon balls 🐉🤣 oh and the cleanest word is uno out or when the guy sips\",\"Bro I thought u were died u haven't posted in like 2 months the last time I saw u\",\"Wow what a funny and original comment.

As mentioned in the video the face cards in the standard deck weren’t documented as having universal names until around the advent of the Paris Pattern. I didn’t actually choose their names (as much as I’d love to 😏) rather went off of the oldest sources I could find which named them. Tarocchi is a different animal entirely and besides the naming of the 5th suit any representation of who they might have been based on is not at all standardized. I’ll be uploading Tarot next month.

The design of magic cards is so well made for speed-reading a card and giving you all the information you need in a glance. Magic is like the street fighter of card games, and the fact that the design of the cards has not changed much is a sign of how well designed are they. Not perfect, but clearly effective. Considering you are playing, that you know the cards in your deck, and that you are thinking about the gameplay rather than the visuals: Name being on top, cost and power being in the same side means you can hold 7 cards in your hand have all the relevant information to know what cards you have just with 10% of the actual cards visible. By revealing 10 % more of the card, you may recognize the art, and you only need to fully see the card if you need to read the text, which is often keyworded for speed. A full read of the card is only needed once when you draw the card, where its all visible anyway, or as a quick reminder while playing. I've always held cards in my hand in a way this is obvious. You just need to fan the cards the other way. As a designer, when you see a flaw on the top dogs, you need to ask yourself whether or not you are the one making a mistake, and analyse why that mistake is there, rather than thinking \\\"its old, they didnt know any better, and players dont want it to change because they are dumb\\\". That said, the design of yugi-ho text is horrendous for new players.\",\"And I will do the videographing for you\",\"#2 is very poor design. Just have the information in a consistent location. Putting it in an importance “hierarchy” leads to a good portion of the card not mattering and the art on your example looks abysmal.\",\"@@awesomeoptimus9093Yeah pretty average uno game if you ask me\",\"Does anyone know the name of the song?\",\"@@syaredzaashrafi1101 never heard of it before but I'll watch it.

In a tcg, you only carry your decks and some dice, not the rules.\",\"Yea I agree\",\"You said that art doesn't contribute to playability, but I don't think that's correct. Art is much easier to recognize than names, it's much easier to realize what cards are in your hand, on the table, or find something looking through the deck by looking at the art than by reading the names. Art is important for the same reason as all the other rules, they make the cards more readable.\",\"@@schwarzerritter5724 open a fan with your right hand and see how the cards are pushed\",\"This made me sub.❤\",\"Mi potresti regalare le blackflower Mi servirebbe un mazzo per iniziare.\",\"I'm such a fucking nerd I recognized Diaconis' name from his paper Tracing the Dovetail Shuffle to its Lair from when I wanted to program an accurate shuffle function\",\"Io ho la coppia di mazzi rarissimi (100 pezzi totali) \\\"animal\\\" e \\\"bird\\\" gold di Natalia Silva.

Most people can't visualize a 2\\u002f25 chance, but they can understand \\\"if you draw an ace.\\\" It also helps to control the spread of options. For example, in dice-based games, there is no limit to your ability to roll well or roll poorly, which means one person _could_ never roll under 15 on their raw D20 while the next person never rolls over 5. But a limited number and selection of playing cards means you can only ever get four kings, four 2s, etc. This makes them useful for the indie TTRPG designers I know who want to ensure nobody has an accidental advantage or disadvantage in play.

Piacentine and Napoletane are 2 out of the 11 Italian decks with the swords\\u002fwands\\u002fcoins\\u002fcups suits, the others being Siciliane, Romagnole, Sarde, Bresciane, Bergamasche, Trentine, Triestine, Trevisane and Bolognesi, all of which are 40-card decks, except the Bresciane which are a 52-card deck. Additionally, there are 4 french-suited decks, all with 40 cards, namely Milanesi, Toscane, Genovesi and Piemontesi. Finally, there's also a German-suited 40 card deck, the Salisburghesi, totaling 16 visually and sometimes mechanically different decks across all Italy. But that's not all! There's a completely unique deck made for playing a game called cucco (or cucù, or stu) that still survives in the area surrounding Montorio al Vomano within the Abruzzo region. That game can still be played with a more common 40-card deck, but it's rare to see it played with that specialized deck, especially outside of the aforementioned area.\",\"‼️🦾🧠soooooooooooooooooool cool 😎\",\"is it just me or the noses look like penises?\",\"That has to be the hardest uno fight I’ve ever seen.

The copy I show in the video is marked 1971 and has 112 cards in it. In my book, Timeless Toys, I write: \\\"While Bob Tezak served as the company figurehead, Ed Akeman ran day-to-day business. International Games started in Akeman’s Lockport, Illinois apartment, and because the game was not available in many stores outside of Cincinnati, Ed took write-in orders directly from Uno fans and shipped games from his apartment-turned-warehouse. Store orders trickled in as the game started to take off. “I would pass cases of Uno out the first floor window of my apartment, directly to the UPS man,” Akeman remembered. “That was how we began.” Part of the purchase from the Robbins family included inventory, and after they sold out of the remaining original “pea-soup” green Uno games, International Games (or IGI as they were known) made several changes....\\\"\",\"33 sec ago\",\"One thing most cards are missing (which is weird because regular playing cards have that) is an index. In most games you still hold your cards fanned in your hand. You just can't see ANY info. Sometimes the background is different, giving you some information (like a type or something in MtG). But that's it. Hearthstone gets away with it, because they assist with highlighted borders. A card that can be played is green. A card that targets a minion can't be played with no minions on the field, even if the cost is within your current budget. A card that has a special effect gets a yellow border. Often this border appears when an effect occurs like \\\"look, your opponent played a type-X minion. This card has a bonus that just activated\\\". That's a luxury that non-virtual games don't have. IF I have a card in my hand that is strong against the undead, I want to see it at one glance. If a card has a combo effect, I want to see it at one glance, so I can plan my move). Not many games even have this kind of info as an icon (hearthstone does in a limited form with icons for special effects, death cry etc - on the bottom of the card). In many games you need to read the text to get an idea what this card is about. If you translate the text to klingon, a water type with a kombo effect is indistinguishable from a fire type with a permanent buff during certain conditions). That makes it very hard for new players to enter the game and makes strategizing a long process. The more cards you have, the worse it gets.\",\"Ok champ\",\"aye your born to be a content creator my guy\",\"I'm still waiting for the next patch to balance the poker meta\",\"BRO PLEASE DO MORE\",\"😅😂😂😂\",\"good video\",\"you just introduced me into so many more days and weeks of solitaire.....thank you for your service\",\"Video fra 10 anni \\\"Ho comprato una casa solo per le carte\\\"\",\"Grande Jack ti seguo da quando avevi neanche 100 iscritti.

Also as you have flops, turn and river stages it enriches the strategy as each player tries to calculate whether they have the best hand early and want to raise aggressively to reduce the odds of an opponent making a really strong hand later etc. The scope of strategising and mind games is deeper and richer than other versions.\",\"Haahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahah\",\"Fr😂😂\",\"Ogni anno una goduria per gli occhi\",\"Exactamente\",\"I learned to count playing poker with my family.

I think it comes from playing video games as much as I have, but it was also because I specifically fan my cards the way I do due to Magic Card layouts. The power and toughness is very inconveniently under my right hand thumb, but knowing the cost rules out cards before their power and toughness is relevant anyway, so I can move my thumb to see that or the card effect. Whichever I need to see right now. Memorizing my cards also lets me only consider them on if I can play them or not, which means my method of fanning which is just \\\"reverse how you do it\\\" and is just as easy and viable as your method. Not sure why you do it that way unless you're playing Poker, honestly. But anyway, that's not a flaw on the cards. It's a very minor mistake in your method of holding them. In the case of Magic the cost is simply on the same side as the power and toughness to allow you to expose both at the same time. This is particularly useful is OG Magic where you had many monsters that only had a power and toughness and no effect, so you could stack them to cover everything except the card's colors (in the cost), and power and toughness on the same side. I'm not making this comment to say \\\"you're wrong\\\" because you're not! Just like with your method of fanning your hand works best for Poker and some other games but not for Magic, it's an element of the game that's designed for. There is no \\\"correct location\\\" for a cost. There is only a \\\"best location for your game\\\" for a cost assuming you have a cost. So yeah, you're right in your case, but I wanted to make this comment to help anyone new to game design understand that like all other examples and rules of design the location of your card's cost is up to interpretation within the confines of your game. Also try fanning your Magic cards out with your thumb instead.\",\"Fr😂😂\",\"I mean thay can’t keep things straight thare😭🙏\",\"no, i don't think i will\",\"can you pls make a remake of this vid\",\"Ah e terribili\",\"😍🔥\",\"Jack sei un grande ogni anno fai questo video e ogni anno viene più bello con più mazzi.

Inoltre, se non fosse possibile aggiungere carte a burraco 'chiuso', come si farebbe a calare una scala reale? Ancora, è sempre obbligatorio posizionare le carte di traverso alla base del burraco, cioè con questa azione poi lo si chiude definitivamente?

However you can award a “black hand” bonus for points games. Just make sure to announce that before play to avoid disagreements. I’ve played a 40 point bonus (like the first bonus in the “married couple” variation). This gives you a nice advantage but keeps it fair.

You dont need two different spheres of different colours to define attack and defense values, information like tribe or the colour of a card does not need to be communicated as a large sigil in the center of the card. Knowing when to use graphics and when to just leave it streamlined is a huge thing for card design. In my experience the most important information is: What kind of card is it When can i use it (instant vs sorcery) What and how much resources does it use What it actually does. And that order is important as it decreses thinking time.

Despite the fact that Italy became an independent country only in 1861, an Italian national identity has been existing since the Middle Ages, even if it wasn't as strong as it has been since the 19th century. Dante Alighieri (who lived in the second half of the 13th century) was the first one who tried to invent an Italian language that could create a bond between the various people that lived in the Italian peninsula. Many other Italian men have tried to encourage their countrymen to join together in one state throughout the centuries, long before 1861. Also, the name \\\"Italy\\\" (\\\"Italia\\\" in Latin) was given to the peninsula by the ancient Romans centuries before the birth of Christ. Admittedly, the inhabitants of Italy at the time were called Italics, not Italians, but the peninsula had the same name as today.

Hold'em has a great combination between face up cards and hole cards (personally i think PLO's combination is even better) There's also Chris Moneymaker's legendary win on tv in 2003, a rag to riches story that made the news. What did he play? NLHE. Just a few years before that, the GOAT poker movie Rounders 1998 came out. Most of the games in the movie was Stud and near the start:\\\"NLHE is the cadillac of poker\\\" \\\"Some people, pros even, won't play no limit hold'em, they can't handle the swings\\\" Now it's no longer the poker cadillac, everyone plays it and stud is almost obsolete. Even games of Limit Hold'em in a casino like in the Johnny Chan scene are super rare now\",\"Nicely done informative content\",\"On that first rule, I fan with my thumb, not with my fingers. I think it comes from playing video games as much as I have, but it was also because I specifically fan my cards the way I do due to Magic Card layouts. The power and toughness is very inconveniently under my right hand thumb, but knowing the cost rules out cards before their power and toughness is relevant anyway, so I can move my thumb to see that or the card effect. Whichever I need to see right now. Memorizing my cards also lets me only consider them on if I can play them or not, which means my method of fanning which is just \\\"reverse how you do it\\\" and is just as easy and viable as your method. Not sure why you do it that way unless you're playing Poker, honestly. But anyway, that's not a flaw on the cards. It's a very minor mistake in your method of holding them. In the case of Magic the cost is simply on the same side as the power and toughness to allow you to expose both at the same time. This is particularly useful is OG Magic where you had many monsters that only had a power and toughness and no effect, so you could stack them to cover everything except the card's colors (in the cost), and power and toughness on the same side. I'm not making this comment to say \\\"you're wrong\\\" because you're not! Just like with your method of fanning your hand works best for Poker and some other games but not for Magic, it's an element of the game that's designed for. There is no \\\"correct location\\\" for a cost. There is only a \\\"best location for your game\\\" for a cost assuming you have a cost. So yeah, you're right in your case, but I wanted to make this comment to help anyone new to game design understand that like all other examples and rules of design the location of your card's cost is up to interpretation within the confines of your game. Also try fanning your Magic cards out with your thumb instead.\",\"Grande Jack\",\"Whats the music\",\"io ne ho 10 di mazzi più uno doppio. 😂 comunque grande jack\",\"This is daily uno mental gymnastic😂\",\"There is no history to record because people just play games and make up rules as they go along.

It's played with 52 card deck, 4 cards are placed on the table and each player is dealt 4 cards. A game is played by picking up cards as same as in Scopa. The difference is that you don't get extra points for sweeping the table but Jacks have a power of doing that. So regardless of the nubmer of cards on the table and their number, a Jack can take them all. Jacks, Queens and Kings do not have a number value. Points are given as follows: 1) One point for each club collected 2) One point for more cards collected 3) One point for a two of clubs (\\\"little two\\\") 4) One point for a ten of diamonds (\\\"big ten\\\")\",\"Independent works are what true art is.\",\"This was fascinating.

But I do agree, that it at the very least should be a consideration during the design phase. If used it should only be placed in non-intrusive place so it doesn't shift focus. This rules out the corner of a card as an option, but something like faded text integrated to the bottom of a picture or perhaps at the bottom of the card itself are more valid options. The latter is what MTG use now, apparently called \\\"collection number\\\". I'm not a fan of it because it is ugly - but it is fine, I guess. Not something I have any use for. There can be some gains. Like in games where the number is integral to the game mechanics (e.g. Bang! where a number\\u002fsuit can blow you up or save you from being shot), or games where additional rules often is needed (makes for faster rulebook index). Looking up a number is definitely faster than names\\u002fwords. It doesn't matter in simple games (e.g. Settlers of Catan, where all cards are numbered) and where a little extra clutter won't make much difference. OT: Getting increasingly annoyed of all the different languages of games. You can relatively easily get hold of the German, French or Dutch version of games like Oriflamme here in the EU, but you'll often need to double or triple the cost to import a proper English\\u002finternational version. Games are already expensive enough to get hold on here in Denmark...

My point is that while the cards aren't perfect, the location of the mana value isn't so bad it could be considered a design flaw. Sure, some information might be hidden in some case because some players might hold their hand in a way that hides the information BUT all they have to do, if they want that information, is slightly adjust their fingers. That's hardly a flaw. Also, I am a game designer with 15 years of experience and a degree in development. I did freelance graphic design on the side of that for 5 years.

In fact, it allows a fine grain hierarchy on the power level, even when there are effects that manipulate those stats. For example, a monster with 2450 atk is stronger than a 2400 but weaker than a 2500. And even if an effect halves their atk, the monster has 1225 atk, wich keeps it stronger than the 1200 and weaker than the 1250. If there were only 2 digits, all three would have 12 atk, removing the power hierarchy on them. Also, there are archetypes that can take advantage of halving your life points. If you have 8000 life points, you can half them 12 times (keeping 1 LP). If you had only 2 digits, you could only half 6 times your 80 LP.\",\"Bellissimo video, sta diventando l'enciclopedia delle carte!\",\"This already got like 100 million views on tiktok not just dropped\",\"This feels like a conversation yuno and Asta would have 😂\",\"The joker is used as a spare if you loose a card you write on the joker the symbol and color of the lost card and play with it\",\"Jack sei un grande\",\"im here to BUST\",\"prossima serie: ho costruito un castello con mazzi di carte 😂😂\",\"She reads the script like it’s a corporate mandated sexual harassment course\",\"Every Friday night for me\",\"Yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not someone I yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not someone I yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was play a job for was going to pick a color the other guy was going to you have then he would have to draw all those cards that you were going to\",\"BRO İTS SO GOOD\",\"That's not the point you goofballs😂😂 he's just saying that 10 people in general will make you feel that way.\",\"3:16 The Full Tilt chip sounds really hit me in the nostalgia\",\"This is the kind of top-quality stuff YouTube was made for\",\"🫥 i hope they put your ass to work lil man\",\"Yes, it would probably be better that Demon Slayer.

People are being cheated every single day wether they are playing live or online. It doesn't matter if you are playing a tournament or a cash game you are so likely to be cheated. From the smallest micro stakes online to the highest stakes at your local casino, you can't escape it. Collusion, marked cards, RTA (real time assistance) are just some of the ways people cheat. Even if you are not being cheated the casual recreational player has very little chance of winning in the long run. The amount of strategy information on the game is overwhelming. There are an endless supply of books on the game. Dozens of training sites. Software online to study your game and track your opponents. Poker Coaches and study groups. Apps on your phone. It's insane really. The game has been broken down and picked apart into tiny little pieces and the amount of study and playing time needed to be competitive and merely break even is just not worth it. My point is that there are other games to play besides NLH. Dozens. Look into the mixed game tournament at the WSOP. Everyone has heard of 7 Card Stud and 5 Card Draw. Those are great games and there are dozens of variations of those games. Badugi, Omaha Hi\\u002fLo 8 or better, Razz, 2-7 Triple Draw, A-5 Triple Draw, 7 Card Stud Hi\\u002fLo 8 or Better, Limit Holdem, No-Limit 2-7 Single Draw, Pot Limit Omaha (PLO)...The list goes on.

To get around this they have a sub-rule: if you have space to explain the thing, explain the thing. This most commonly occurs with set-specific keywords like Soulbond. What does Soulbond do? Well I can look at my Wingcrafter (which is a common card) and everything I need to know about the keyword is right there. Now when I get a rare or mythic card that JUST has the keyword I already know what it does. So one variation of your card could read: Gain one colourless power shard (colourless power shard symbol).

If you study Magic cards, you’ll see that while they use, for example, the tap symbol when saying “tap the card to do this”, if they mention tapping in the rest of the text they say the word “tap”. They only have a few symbols that they routinely use in the actual ability text: those for mana costs, and even then it’s used sparingly. People know how to read words, but they don’t come to your game knowing what your symbols mean in the context of your game. If you send them to the reference manual too many times to figure out what your symbols mean it’ll be frustrating.

During your opponent's turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 Monster Card treated as a Continuous Spell on the field; Special Summon it to your field. If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Special Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY. You can only use each effect of \\\"Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon\\\" once per turn. | But if the cards didn't explain all their rulings in the text and only said the most important parts (losing the nuance) a revised friendly version would read like: - Place 1 face-up monster on the field or GY, in its owner's Backrow as a Continuous Spell. - During your opponent's turn (Instant): You can Summon monster treated as a continuous spell to your field. - If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY. It's still a lot of text and Konami had no Idea how ridiculous the game would get and it's funny that removing texy from mosy modern cards msked then infinitely stronger.\",\"11:20 I actually really like card games that have their art in a frame on the card like the big 3 Magic, Pokemon, and Yugioh do. It keeps the image clear and unobscured by mechanical aspects of the game shown in text or icons. It means that when I'm looking at the art I'm looking at the art unobstructed and able to appreciate it fully, and when I'm looking for mechanical components I can find them where I know they will be without the colors and shapes of the art behind them distracting my eye and changing the color and shape language of the area around the game mechanic icon or text. I also care about my cards, and when a nick at the edge of a card damages a black or yellow, or white border or whatever, I don't care so much, but if it damages the edge of the card art I'm much more invested and bummed out by it. I can appreciate the odd full card art style from time to time, but I never use those cards, with the exception of simple resource cards such as energies in Pokemon or lands in Magic where there isn't really any other icons or text to worry about obscuring and the image is simple enough that it won't matter so much. I know it would make all card games look exactly the same if they have an art frame, and the art is in the upper half of the card, and the name is above that, and maybe that chokes the market a lot by new games looking \\\"samey\\\" at a glance, but if you make your game have art to the edges, and card information on top of the art, it fatigues me mentally over time in a way that's not necessary, and I won't pick up those cards to play as often as I might have if I wasn't fatigued by just looking at them. The golden rule here should be \\\"Treat your art like any other image on your card. You wouldn't layer icons or make text run across them. Don't layer icons or text over images. Art is paramount.\\\" The image is just a bigger icon which is more unique from other icons so it can serve to identify the card at a glance. It should be respected as such. For example, the big green orb your game puts overlapping the base of the card art could have been a green bar that served as a bottom frame with a much smaller circle or diamond part at the middle of the line where your green orb is located. Small enough that it doesn't intrude visually on the image above or the information below, but wide enough as a bar to always be visible no matter where your thumb lands while holding it. Almost the width of the card. I'd actually recommend making this change in your own game's layout in future card sets if it's a persistent game, or later editions if it's a boxed card game. The big colorful circle is fun and whimsical at first glance, but it's also just a massive blank green field on the card that's wasting space and obscuring other elements. If it was white or black you'd see it for the wasted space it is as designed. It kind of feels like I had paint on my thumb when I was playing the game one time and now that smudge won't ever come off. Anyway, I wasn't trying to be too harsh, and I realize this is a lot of criticism in one of 3 comments on a video with 5 golden rules, so I want to end this one saying these observations aren't terrible. We all have our own methods and opinions.

If you play anything from Fantasy Flight games, like Arkham Horror, or Marvel Champions, on the bottom of the card they'll often have a set symbol and then a number. Like a skull then a 148. If you can't use the symbol (like asking on a text only forum or something) translating the set is far easier than translating the card name. A card named \\\"black knight\\\" in another language may not actually be called the equivalent in English (usually because a name may have unwanted connotations, like if a word or phrase could be considered rude in one language but not another).

Yes, MtG putting the cost in the wrong top corner is \\\"ok\\\" because you can fan the hand backwards if you don't have the cards in your deck memorized yet, but doing so will hide the name of the cards. Some people resort to stacking their hand vertically with the entire top like of every card visible, while others sort their hand by cost so you know \\\"everything else costs more than the top one\\\". MtG only gets away with breaking the rule because it's too entrenched to fix it now.

And yes, I'm right handed. So anyway in conclusion idk if that rule which you said is actually true or not, honestly. I mean the rule sure but he using left vs right not that sure. Maybe I do it like that because in the card games I played the most (Yugioh and MTG) it's better to fan the cards like that? I legit have no clue I just know that it feels natural to do it this way and unnatural the other way and that makes me wonder if it's really true that mana values should be in left and not right... I mean in the kind of cards I want to make that doesn't really matters and I guess it's still better to use the top left if possible since we read left-right and top-down but yeah quite weird.\",\"@@brianbaker1700I think if the symbols represent a “thing”, and not a property, that may be something easier to understand.

The most important element - the card's attack and defense - was shown as small text under the card's effect\\u002fflavor text, which your opponent could not read from across the table. Meanwhile, the card's level, which only regularly came into play as a possible cost for summoning, was illustrated as a row of bright and colorful star orbs laid out under the card's name. Also, the art looked amateur. The colors and frames looked like someone slapped them together in Photoshop in under 10 minutes. And the idea of the attack, defense, and life points being measured in the thousands was redundant, as it would function the exact same if you chopped off the two zeros and made everything in the double digits.\",\"I wouldn’t call it an edit but ok\",\"About the invisible cost, you assumed people always stack cards from left to right, but if they stack them from right to left then MtG cost is perfectly visible ^^\",\"@@user-Lloyd986 its good but not a movie or made by disney so like, anything better then the disney movies rn\",\"yugi-oh but good\",\"Editing*​@@ahmadrassuly6648\",\"kyojiro rengoku if had uno reverse\",\"@@Wizard_of_the_Tower That's fair, I didn't realize I left that open, good call.\",\"Ryghy😅😅😮vggkiju🎉😢😮😮😮😅ccggg😮😅😅hghbhcxvv😂🤬👏👏🤣🤣🦘🦘🐘🦘🐘🦙🐎🐃\",\"jóóóó mégegy magyar\",\"It wouldn't.

Neither keywording nor iconising are good ideas. They may make cards appear more readable at a glance, but when you actually try to read them for the sake of playing the game, keywording and iconising significantly reduce readability by requiring the player to reference the rulebook. There's a reason that MTG so strongly avoids doing either, using reminder text wherever font size allows and never adding a new icon that hasn't been a variation on the mana symbol (except for that one time they did the untap symbol for thematic reasons and then never did it again). Icons are especially bad because they break up the flow of a sentence - to be able to read the card, I have to learn how to pronounce your icons, and in many cases those icons' pronunciations aren't intuitive. \\\"read crossed swords as combat value\\\" is definitely not. The only time you can get away with icons is when the icons represent game objects, or maybe object properties, but that should still be done very sparingly, and it's a lot less likely to work in a card game than it is a board game.

I also prefer cards to be framed, and text or symbols overlapping art should be kept to an absolute minimum, if at all. In my opinion, Yu-Gi-Oh got it down perfectly when it comes to the art-to-information ratio, and its borders are perfect. Yes, they look like crap *now,* but that's only because they made the mistake of adding more and more complicated effects and thus having to shrink the font down to a size 6. If you revisit some of the classic Yu-Gi-Oh cards you may be pleasantly reminded of just how perfect the layout is.\",\"How- how long did this take?\",\"in moderate defense to having names of cards in the top left corner instead of costs, they can act as a really good information shortcut to really experienced players. as an MTG player, if I saw a fanned out hand of cards in a vacuum and see Counterspell in the top left corner of one of them, I've played the game enough to know exactly how much it costs and what it does just by seeing that name alone, in this case two blue mana. If I saw the cost in that position instead, it's certainly the most useful info I could know about the card while it hasn't yet been played, but (ignoring any other potential visual indicators for the sake of this example like seeing part of the art) I might not necessarily know *what* card it might be of that cost, for all I know the deck might be stacked with other cards that also cost two blue mana. however this only applies once you have played a game enough to tell what any card does just by the name or the art, this doesn't apply to new players which you should be probably be formatting the card's interface in service of. Not saying that the golden rule is straight up wrong or anything, just that if you are going to put something else there, I think the card name would be the second best alternative\",\"Never sit with you back to the door, my friend!\",\"There's a good form of this.

I'll try to demonstrate: This paragraph is easily read, because your brain's more efficient at handling fewer words per Line. Especially when spaced. This paragraph is not quite as easily read, becaus your brain finds it harder to read longer passages of text per line. Spacing's more apparent too.

Also, the art looked amateur. The colors and frames looked like someone slapped them together in Photoshop in under 10 minutes.

Symbols take a ton of memory space to learn since you have to connect them to words in your head anyway, and I get really turned off reading text with too many of them. I feel like MTG does symbols really well: it has 7 recurring symbols (the 5 mana symbols, the colorless mana symbol, and the tap symbol), but all of these fall into categories (mana and tapping). The mana symbols don't take much memory space to tell them apart from each other because they're all the same size and shape, so really you have two symbols- mana symbols and tapping. 2 symbols is a lot easier to memorize than 5 or more, which is something I see in a lot of games nowadays. The symbols in MTG also don't come up when describing interactions between cards. MTG never uses the tap symbol to tell you that a card taps down an opposing creature, only to tell you to tap a card for an effect.\",\"@@The76532 KENTENSHI - paranoia\",\"Bro cook't\",\"ciao io ho messo like\",\"UNO😮😮😮\",\"Thx!\",\"Is it bold to say I liked this edit better than wano arc Luffy vs Kaido!!\",\"FAX BROS SPEAKING FAX\",\"​@@JohanLiebertkiGORND\",\"Facts 😂💯\",\"Frrrrr\",\"W\",\"@@snorristurluson5977 ?\",\"dang, he went there\",\"@@mariosalazar1828 wtf is that💀\",\"This is one of the best anime ever in my life!!!!❤❤\",\"I’m surprised you didn’t talk about the difference between yugioh cards and yugioh rush duel cards in how to improve a card’s design\",\"Hä\",\"Thats just how uno goes btw am your hundredth comment\",\"@@DreadXP-officaldidn’t ask\",\"@@rosdimohd1738 That aged well\",\"😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂\",\"​@@BRUHREALLY-sk6qw 🤖\",\"He really just drunk a coc is just mad crazy and animation is so good bro but the coc made me laugh to death😅😅\",\"IT WILL LITERALLY BE YUGIO VIBES AND MORE DRAMA\",\"Better than that beyblade flop\",\"True but it’s below average uno game with THE boys\",\"@@cacyk410346 seconds ago\",\"​@@SummoButBetter Paranoia if I'm correct\",\"yh\",\"🫥\",\"True😂😂😂😂\",\"Yes\",\"I've been working on my own card game and I'm finding all the details of it fascinating.

Which drugs are you using??\",\"Yeah, I agree with this one. In the video Dave said to \\\"keep the rules on the cards, not in a rule book\\\" or something to that effect, then also said to use symbols when text is repeated. The issue is that if the symbols aren't able to be defined on the card because using the symbol at all is meant to keep information concise, then you're offloading the explanation of the symbols to the rule book which is exactly contradictory to the other advice. The important thing is to consider how the information is conveyed. For example, A \\\"tap\\\" symbol like from Magic avoids needing to use the word \\\"tap\\\" or whatever word you use, in my game's case \\\"tax\\\". It's not that these words are very long. In fact the icon is only a few pixels shorter than the word written in the card's text. And when the card text says to \\\"tap target permanent\\\" or whatever in Magic it spells it out instead of using the icon. But the explanation for what this symbol means is entirely in the rule book. Why is this symbol necessary? The reason it's important is that you don't need to read it at all if it's a symbol, and it identifies it as a cost just like the mana costs. You just take it in at a glance, and you understand it to be a cost because other costs such as mana are in the same location on some cards. Why is mana a symbol? To be concise, yes, but it's more than that. It indexes them. They're all circles with different flavor shapes inside and unique colors from one another. The tap symbol is not mana, but it's also kept round and anyway you have to tap the lands to generate mana, so it's the same function just moved to the card itself. The most important amendment I'd make to the golden rule described in the video about when to use symbols is to use them whenever you would otherwise be repeating a key word, or key phrase, which is only slightly worded differently than the video itself but has a core meaning change. Remember that the reason is because the repeated phrase is important because it has depth that must be precise and universal. It's law. If it didn't need to be taken as law, it wouldn't need to be repeated in the exact same way every time and then fully explained in the rule book. The ability text that's written on a card is a contract, but a contract is just a paper covered in words until the court of law steps in to enforce it. Keywords are law themselves which contracts refer to for authority, and icons replacing keywords are done when the law needs to be identified as similar to one another and therefor indexed together in your mind, or when the keywords are too verbose like my comments. Red circle and blue circle are both indexed as mana in Magic, and mana is currency backed by law. Sometimes the mana symbol is there when it's provided, and sometimes removed. No need for the mana to have a + or - on it, though, because the contract outlines the terms like in all other contracts. Just know that the card has a purchase receipt in the top right corner which is always mana removed by using placement on the card as a language, and the card effect sections have a spot for mana removed as well at the start of the effect, and also for tapping in the same spot. If you find mana inside the text body, however, you need to refer to the rest of the effect contract to see how the law will apply this symbol. Also numbers are just symbols in language that have mathematical laws backing them as well. When you use numbers you're just using symbols who's rulebooks are taught thoroughly at school. 1 is an image that replaces the key word \\\"one\\\", just like 1\\u002f2 replaces \\\"one half\\\", but if you use them just right you can have your rulebook override some mathematical key words such as in Magic when 1\\u002f2 means \\\"1 power and 2 toughness\\\". This is another case of Magic using location as a form of language. 1 is a mathematical keyword that could be anywhere, but because of its location relative to the rest of the card and especially the \\u002f beside it this 1 also means \\\"power\\\" which is a separate keyword also defined in the rule book. Together these mean \\\"one power\\\", which is relevant to like 50 paragraphs of text for \\\"power\\\" in the completed rule book, and entire math degrees worth of information to fully define \\\"one\\\".

In the video Dave said to \\\"keep the rules on the cards, not in a rule book\\\" or something to that effect, then also said to use symbols when text is repeated. The issue is that if the symbols aren't able to be defined on the card because using the symbol at all is meant to keep information concise, then you're offloading the explanation of the symbols to the rule book which is exactly contradictory to the other advice. The important thing is to consider how the information is conveyed. For example, A \\\"tap\\\" symbol like from Magic avoids needing to use the word \\\"tap\\\" or whatever word you use, in my game's case \\\"tax\\\". It's not that these words are very long. In fact the icon is only a few pixels shorter than the word written in the card's text. And when the card text says to \\\"tap target permanent\\\" or whatever in Magic it spells it out instead of using the icon. But the explanation for what this symbol means is entirely in the rule book. Why is this symbol necessary? The reason it's important is that you don't need to read it at all if it's a symbol, and it identifies it as a cost just like the mana costs. You just take it in at a glance, and you understand it to be a cost because other costs such as mana are in the same location on some cards. Why is mana a symbol? To be concise, yes, but it's more than that. It indexes them. They're all circles with different flavor shapes inside and unique colors from one another. The tap symbol is not mana, but it's also kept round and anyway you have to tap the lands to generate mana, so it's the same function just moved to the card itself. The most important amendment I'd make to the golden rule described in the video about when to use symbols is to use them whenever you would otherwise be repeating a key word, or key phrase, which is only slightly worded differently than the video itself but has a core meaning change. Remember that the reason is because the repeated phrase is important because it has depth that must be precise and universal. It's law. If it didn't need to be taken as law, it wouldn't need to be repeated in the exact same way every time and then fully explained in the rule book. The ability text that's written on a card is a contract, but a contract is just a paper covered in words until the court of law steps in to enforce it. Keywords are law themselves which contracts refer to for authority, and icons replacing keywords are done when the law needs to be identified as similar to one another and therefor indexed together in your mind, or when the keywords are too verbose like my comments. Red circle and blue circle are both indexed as mana in Magic, and mana is currency backed by law. Sometimes the mana symbol is there when it's provided, and sometimes removed. No need for the mana to have a + or - on it, though, because the contract outlines the terms like in all other contracts. Just know that the card has a purchase receipt in the top right corner which is always mana removed by using placement on the card as a language, and the card effect sections have a spot for mana removed as well at the start of the effect, and also for tapping in the same spot. If you find mana inside the text body, however, you need to refer to the rest of the effect contract to see how the law will apply this symbol. Also numbers are just symbols in language that have mathematical laws backing them as well. When you use numbers you're just using symbols who's rulebooks are taught thoroughly at school. 1 is an image that replaces the key word \\\"one\\\", just like 1\\u002f2 replaces \\\"one half\\\", but if you use them just right you can have your rulebook override some mathematical key words such as in Magic when 1\\u002f2 means \\\"1 power and 2 toughness\\\". This is another case of Magic using location as a form of language. 1 is a mathematical keyword that could be anywhere, but because of its location relative to the rest of the card and especially the \\u002f beside it this 1 also means \\\"power\\\" which is a separate keyword also defined in the rule book. Together these mean \\\"one power\\\", which is relevant to like 50 paragraphs of text for \\\"power\\\" in the completed rule book, and entire math degrees worth of information to fully define \\\"one\\\". Anyway, I went on a bit of a ramble there. Gonna get back to eating my lunch. 😅\",\"Real\",\"It’s the best quality short I’ve seen all year\",\"your right about that\",\"@@abirhasankhan9327 Young Girl A\",\"FR😂😂\",\"😅😅😅😅😊😅😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤😅😊😊😊\",\"Не жаналық 😢​@@Qceanblue\",\"Nice\",\"@@that_one_offical hellooooooo\",\"Domain expansion:unlimated plus 4 uno card\",\"Iso mas😂\",\"Yes\",\"@@richcheckmaker jack of what?\",\"700th like owo\",\"@@Thickest_boi bro you didn’t end your sentence with proper punctuation so don’t be talking about people’s grammar 😂\",\"Anime directors and authors writing that down\",\"YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THIS GOES HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\"If mappa found him it's over for us\",\"@@DarrianYates young girl a slowed and reverbed\",\"Disney should hire this guy\",\"You know you're talented when you can make an UNO EDIT better than some movies.\",\"That’s so true\",\"2.8k likes and 13 replies?

In starter product each keyword should have an (italics explanation) immediately following the keyword with the rest of the text continuing afterwards. This means that they can read the effect without compromising where in the lines of text they are. You don't want a book with keywords as when players get familiar with their kitchentop friends deck, they know what card they have in their hand when their friend starts rooting through the booklet. You may opt for two-three cards that exist in the players hand perpetually and can be shuffled into the hand that have the keywords and their explanations.

The item cards have the symbols in the text box, and the cost at the top.right corner, but the cost is for buying only (deckbuilder) so it's not needed after it's purchased and in the player's hand. The second game has 11 spaces for icons at the right side of the cards, which are present in all cards regardless of type.

There's some tradeoffs compared to graphical symbols though; particularly I think graphical symbols stand out more and can stand out even in small spaces, but keywords can be more intuitive to read especially in terms of pronouncing a card out loud (like if trying to describe a card in Magic that has Haste, one just says \\\"it has haste\\\", but if it had some symbol like a person running or similar it might not be obvious how to say it without checking the rules). I think with a CCG the large potential card pool makes it make sense to have some priority on being able to pronounce text easily while that might not be necessary in the scope of a single board game.

Including it shouldn't make any legal difference. Denmark is like The Netherlands at the very top when it comes to English as a second language. This is largely due to tv with subtitles and of course the high use of internet. Tv doesn't get duped here except for some kids shows\\u002fmovies and the frankly horrible series shown on Disney-channel. You can easily show English youtube to pupils without much issues. It is something I've done a lot when teaching science, mostly to age 10-13. I agree that it is weird why the Netherlands doesn't just use the English version of games, instead of bothering with translation. I guess it's mostly because of nationalism, pride and tradition :). The Netherlands has triple the population compared to Denmark, so it is also a larger marked, but still relatively small. I personally would love the idea of Danish being slowly out phased, but English isn't a particular good language in its current form, being a mix of multiple languages explains the horrible connection between spelling and pronunciation of words. I agree that games can be simplified, but I think games like \\\"Monopoly\\\" would be a hard sell. You would remove a lot of the fun by changing the names to merely colours. The game is called Matador in Denmark and is from 1936. It is a slightly changed version of Monopoly, but has unmistakingly the same core gameplay. It has always used the same street names and is considered nothing less than a cult board game. Part of the fun is owning famous\\u002fhistorical streets, like getting \\\"Rådhuspladesen\\\" (AKA the town square in Copenhagen) it is something very special.

There's some tradeoffs compared to graphical symbols though; particularly I think graphical symbols stand out more and can stand out even in small spaces, but keywords can be more intuitive to read especially in terms of pronouncing a card out loud (like if trying to describe a card in Magic that has Haste, one just says \\\"it has haste\\\", but if it had some symbol like a person running or similar it might not be obvious how to say it without checking the rules). I think with a CCG the large potential card pool makes it make sense to have some priority on being able to pronounce text easily while that might not be necessary in the scope of a single board game. I wonder also if perhaps some particular kinds of gameplay elements are better suited to graphical representation while others work better textually.\",\"Yu-Gi-Oh but Yugi got tired of Monster Duels\",\"Dang\",\"​@@Thickest_boibros a nerd💀\",\"TRUE\",\"For real is a🥤😮😊😶 w edit\",\"Felicidades mi estimado caballero ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ esta bello la edicion 🎉🎉\",\"Best edit ever\",\"@@RyderPlaysOfficcalthats wild 😭\",\"..

For CCG's I'm on board 100%, I tried to keep this video valuable to anyone designing a cards layout for any reason but it was mostly through the lens of board games. I have a bias because our game is leaning more towards the other direction and needs to be readable on the table and not in your hand.

Neither keywording nor iconising are good ideas. They may make cards appear more readable at a glance, but when you actually try to read them for the sake of playing the game, keywording and iconising significantly reduce readability by requiring the player to reference the rulebook. There's a reason that MTG so strongly avoids doing either, using reminder text wherever font size allows and never adding a new icon that hasn't been a variation on the mana symbol (except for that one time they did the untap symbol for thematic reasons and then never did it again). Icons are especially bad because they break up the flow of a sentence - to be able to read the card, I have to learn how to pronounce your icons, and in many cases those icons' pronunciations aren't intuitive. \\\"read crossed swords as combat value\\\" is definitely not. The only time you can get away with icons is when the icons represent game objects, or maybe object properties, but that should still be done very sparingly, and it's a lot less likely to work in a card game than it is a board game. Under no circumstances should an action ever be iconed.\",\"@brickmotionpictures1  let me fix this real quick 1 seconed alright here's the fixed version.

Symbols take a ton of memory space to learn since you have to connect them to words in your head anyway, and I get really turned off reading text with too many of them. I feel like MTG does symbols really well: it has 7 recurring symbols (the 5 mana symbols, the colorless mana symbol, and the tap symbol), but all of these fall into categories (mana and tapping). The mana symbols don't take much memory space to tell them apart from each other because they're all the same size and shape, so really you have two symbols- mana symbols and tapping. 2 symbols is a lot easier to memorize than 5 or more, which is something I see in a lot of games nowadays. The symbols in MTG also don't come up when describing interactions between cards. MTG never uses the tap symbol to tell you that a card taps down an opposing creature, only to tell you to tap a card for an effect.\",\"🤐☠️☠️🤯🥵🥶😈☠️🥇🎖️🏆📀🛑🛑🔇🔇\",\"a great example is M:tG has a gravestone symbol in a corner to indicate an ability that lets you play the card from the discard pile.\",\"I want to see the full story\",\"@@that_1_man18exactly😂\",\"@@Resurrectedcringecop attention seeker\",\"FRR HAHAHA\",\"​@@tenzobinju1481 that would be a cool edit to see ngl\",\"i think it's an underexaggeration of what goes on in Uno\",\"What app did you use to edit this?\",\"@@TheUnkGamerdisneyneed to pay its animators and actors\",\"fr\",\"​@@SummoButBetteractual song it's called \\\"anonymous girl A\\\"\",\"That is a mechanical skill we've all learned from playing the game.

Although they are long, the effects can be complex, and have a lot of specific limitations on when and how often they can be used. The latter is really what half of the text is. Terms and conditions. Additionally, in Asian language prints, they list out and give each effect a card has by a number, and reference each numbered effect whenever necessary. Also, makes it easy to know where one effect ends, and the other begins. All other languages, you have to read through a block of text, and deduce logically where each one ends, and each one begins. The Asian region is run and overseen by a different branch of Konami compared to the one in the West. So that is likely one reason why this format hasn't been moved over. One thing I actually would like to see get implemented. And keywords discourse I've found to be pretty touchy subject too within the community. Some players seem to loathe the idea because everything isn't spelled out directly to them, and increases the number of things new players need to learn, or something to those lines. When the game alreaady technically has 2 keywords that exist (Excavate and piercing). Adding in a few more to very specific actions that cannot have variations wouldn't be the end of the world. Although keywords in Yugioh in general is hard, since you can have like 6 different variations of a similar thing. Like in MTG, you have hexproof. It does one thing. While in Yugioh, you have cards that have similar abilities, but sometimes only for specific kinds of cards (Like only from Spells or only from monsters). You also have cards that are kind of reverse (Unaffected by anything that doesn't target it). At that point, it is probably easier to just be explicit with it at the cost of some real estate.\",\"@@bucketplayz43bro how about this🤓🖕\",\"no way to change your mind\",\"Why not just look at the card portrait image?

It keeps the image clear and unobscured by mechanical aspects of the game shown in text or icons. It means that when I'm looking at the art I'm looking at the art unobstructed and able to appreciate it fully, and when I'm looking for mechanical components I can find them where I know they will be without the colors and shapes of the art behind them distracting my eye and changing the color and shape language of the area around the game mechanic icon or text. I also care about my cards, and when a nick at the edge of a card damages a black or yellow, or white border or whatever, I don't care so much, but if it damages the edge of the card art I'm much more invested and bummed out by it. I can appreciate the odd full card art style from time to time, but I never use those cards, with the exception of simple resource cards such as energies in Pokemon or lands in Magic where there isn't really any other icons or text to worry about obscuring and the image is simple enough that it won't matter so much. I know it would make all card games look exactly the same if they have an art frame, and the art is in the upper half of the card, and the name is above that, and maybe that chokes the market a lot by new games looking \\\"samey\\\" at a glance, but if you make your game have art to the edges, and card information on top of the art, it fatigues me mentally over time in a way that's not necessary, and I won't pick up those cards to play as often as I might have if I wasn't fatigued by just looking at them. The golden rule here should be \\\"Treat your art like any other image on your card. You wouldn't layer icons or make text run across them. Don't layer icons or text over images. Art is paramount.\\\" The image is just a bigger icon which is more unique from other icons so it can serve to identify the card at a glance. It should be respected as such. For example, the big green orb your game puts overlapping the base of the card art could have been a green bar that served as a bottom frame with a much smaller circle or diamond part at the middle of the line where your green orb is located. Small enough that it doesn't intrude visually on the image above or the information below, but wide enough as a bar to always be visible no matter where your thumb lands while holding it. Almost the width of the card. I'd actually recommend making this change in your own game's layout in future card sets if it's a persistent game, or later editions if it's a boxed card game. The big colorful circle is fun and whimsical at first glance, but it's also just a massive blank green field on the card that's wasting space and obscuring other elements. If it was white or black you'd see it for the wasted space it is as designed. It kind of feels like I had paint on my thumb when I was playing the game one time and now that smudge won't ever come off. Anyway, I wasn't trying to be too harsh, and I realize this is a lot of criticism in one of 3 comments on a video with 5 golden rules, so I want to end this one saying these observations aren't terrible.

They only have a few symbols that they routinely use in the actual ability text: those for mana costs, and even then it’s used sparingly. People know how to read words, but they don’t come to your game knowing what your symbols mean in the context of your game. If you send them to the reference manual too many times to figure out what your symbols mean it’ll be frustrating.

If I saw the cost in that position instead, it's certainly the most useful info I could know about the card while it hasn't yet been played, but (ignoring any other potential visual indicators for the sake of this example like seeing part of the art) I might not necessarily know *what* card it might be of that cost, for all I know the deck might be stacked with other cards that also cost two blue mana. however this only applies once you have played a game enough to tell what any card does just by the name or the art, this doesn't apply to new players which you should be probably be formatting the card's interface in service of.

In your game, I see the big green green in your card. So when the effect asks if the card below is [green gem], I immediately get what it means, even if \\\"green gem\\\" isn't the right term.

And also racism in the name of \\\"wokeness\\\" Marvel is the biggest franchise of all time Star wars is the second biggest Marvel became the biggest even before Disney then they bought it because it was big then they made a few more movies before going haywire Star wars was already big And you're telling me only a few people hate Disney?\",\"I like how in Terraforming Mars, the card abilities are written entirely in symbols, and they have a tiny explanation in words at the bottom. It's very easy to understand cards from across the table at a glance, and even if you can't, most cards are single use so there are only a few cards to memorize (and because of the huge iconography, it's memorization with a huge hint).\",\"real\",\"@@UnaTried and kinda\",\"Grazie a te\",\"W\",\"IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS\",\"THE ONE UNO\",\"Bro has a point\",\"As an autistic person; please only say it with fewer words if doing so doesn’t rely on a bunch of external context.

Including it shouldn't make any legal difference. Denmark is like The Netherlands at the very top when it comes to English as a second language. This is largely due to tv with subtitles and of course the high use of internet. Tv doesn't get duped here except for some kids shows\\u002fmovies and the frankly horrible series shown on Disney-channel. You can easily show English youtube to pupils without much issues. It is something I've done a lot when teaching science, mostly to age 10-13. I agree that it is weird why the Netherlands doesn't just use the English version of games, instead of bothering with translation. I guess it's mostly because of nationalism, pride and tradition :). The Netherlands has triple the population compared to Denmark, so it is also a larger marked, but still relatively small. I personally would love the idea of Danish being slowly out phased, but English isn't a particular good language in its current form, being a mix of multiple languages explains the horrible connection between spelling and pronunciation of words. I agree that games can be simplified, but I think games like \\\"Monopoly\\\" would be a hard sell. You would remove a lot of the fun by changing the names to merely colours. The game is called Matador in Denmark and is from 1936. It is a slightly changed version of Monopoly, but has unmistakingly the same core gameplay. It has always used the same street names and is considered nothing less than a cult board game. Part of the fun is owning famous\\u002fhistorical streets, like getting \\\"Rådhuspladesen\\\" (AKA the town square in Copenhagen) it is something very special. The name adds to the experience. @@borstenpinsel\",\"Bro dropped the hardest edit in existence, then dipped 😂\",\"TRUE\",\"@@imeldaenysurayaramlan4221 yes💀💀\",\"Uno: The Anime Edition 😂😂 The only card game that can rival Yugioh in its prime\",\"Bro, I wanna be an epic editor and make edits like yours.

And yes, I'm right handed. So anyway in conclusion idk if that rule which you said is actually true or not, honestly. I mean the rule sure but he using left vs right not that sure. Maybe I do it like that because in the card games I played the most (Yugioh and MTG) it's better to fan the cards like that? I legit have no clue I just know that it feels natural to do it this way and unnatural the other way and that makes me wonder if it's really true that mana values should be in left and not right...

Although they are long, the effects can be complex, and have a lot of specific limitations on when and how often they can be used. The latter is really what half of the text is. Terms and conditions. Additionally, in Asian language prints, they list out and give each effect a card has by a number, and reference each numbered effect whenever necessary. Also, makes it easy to know where one effect ends, and the other begins. All other languages, you have to read through a block of text, and deduce logically where each one ends, and each one begins. The Asian region is run and overseen by a different branch of Konami compared to the one in the West. So that is likely one reason why this format hasn't been moved over. One thing I actually would like to see get implemented. And keywords discourse I've found to be pretty touchy subject too within the community. Some players seem to loathe the idea because everything isn't spelled out directly to them, and increases the number of things new players need to learn, or something to those lines. When the game alreaady technically has 2 keywords that exist (Excavate and piercing). Adding in a few more to very specific actions that cannot have variations wouldn't be the end of the world. Although keywords in Yugioh in general is hard, since you can have like 6 different variations of a similar thing. Like in MTG, you have hexproof. It does one thing. While in Yugioh, you have cards that have similar abilities, but sometimes only for specific kinds of cards (Like only from Spells or only from monsters). You also have cards that are kind of reverse (Unaffected by anything that doesn't target it). At that point, it is probably easier to just be explicit with it at the cost of some real estate.\",\"@@Play-In-Games I feel like it's a relatively safe bet that a French publisher at the time would be pro Catholic, especially given that their use of Christian iconography.

To get around this they have a sub-rule: if you have space to explain the thing, explain the thing. This most commonly occurs with set-specific keywords like Soulbond. What does Soulbond do? Well I can look at my Wingcrafter (which is a common card) and everything I need to know about the keyword is right there. Now when I get a rare or mythic card that JUST has the keyword I already know what it does. So one variation of your card could read: Gain one colourless power shard (colourless power shard symbol). If the card below this one is (green), this card has a combat value (sword) of 1.\",\"cool\",\"@@Allyourbusinessokay shut up please you bots are so annoying\",\"@@Iusethis4commentsthe latter\",\"what editing app do you use and how the actual fu..\",\"Grande Jackkkkkk\",\"2867 likes and 12 replies?

During your opponent's turn (Quick Effect): You can target 1 Monster Card treated as a Continuous Spell on the field; Special Summon it to your field. If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Special Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY. You can only use each effect of \\\"Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon\\\" once per turn. | But if the cards didn't explain all their rulings in the text and only said the most important parts (losing the nuance) a revised friendly version would read like: - Place 1 face-up monster on the field or GY, in its owner's Backrow as a Continuous Spell. - During your opponent's turn (Instant): You can Summon monster treated as a continuous spell to your field. - If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY: You can Summon 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY.

For one of them, I'm trying to replace every single line of text in the dungeon crawling cards with symbols, and even if it's easy to read if you know what the symbols mean, it will probably be overwhelming for the new players and I will probably need to make a full document explaining each card (but it wont be included in the game, just a link to access it). The item cards have the symbols in the text box, and the cost at the top.right corner, but the cost is for buying only (deckbuilder) so it's not needed after it's purchased and in the player's hand. The second game has 11 spaces for icons at the right side of the cards, which are present in all cards regardless of type. The icons on those spaces vary depending on the type, but the general theme of the icons share the same spot. I'm still working on the design, tho, but the idea is fine i think, I just need it to look more professional.\",\"Your editing skills are *impeccable!*\",\"Hardest beat in my life\",\"Fatalità un

so much as that Gangar card is literal eye cancer. As for the Magic Card, sure there's some minor merit to your Rule 1, but it's *very* minor. As you say later, the cards in your hand are indeed the cards you put into your deck, so you don't need the mana cost visible all the time while you have things tightly fanned. People have object permanence and minor memory capacities. They can see the mana cost (and other info) and then remember it for most cards even when it's obscured. Furthermore, The mana cost being on the left side under the name of Tarmogoyf now causes two problems. First is that it's obscuring the picture, and the picture is the most important thing because - again - people remember the info on their own cards. They just need to recognize which card they have, and that mana cost there is obscuring the image if there are similar 1-F green cards. Two, the beauty of Magic cards is that everything is placed in its own relevant space, so you can find the information you want about the card by looking at a distinct section of it. name, image, mana cost, creature type, power\\u002ftoughness, effects (and sometimes flavor text). They're partitioned out so everything is clear and the info for one section doesn't distract from info in another section. This puts the mana cost and the name in the same spot, and makes the mana cost unclear because of the curved behavior. This works for something that costs some colorless mana and a single colored mana, but what if it cost 3 forests? 5 forests? Now the mana cost design has to curve around and make the spacing uneven and make counting harder. So your format is either going to suck for some cards, or you're going to only use this format for cards with few colored mana, making a split standard which makes it that much worse to look at cards and evaluate their information at a glance. Because now you need to look in two different locations with two different formats for mana cost. Which is why that Gangar card is such cancer. The image now covers the whole damn thing, being distracting in general and making reading any of the text a nightmare. Well defined borders and information is important. And no, it doesn't have to be \\\"most to least important, top to bottom\\\" like some kind of passage in a book. The important thing is that relevant information is visible, and in its own space so you can instantly fixate on whatever information is most Sorry but, while this video was nicely produced, you're speaking like these design rules are gospel. And that'd be fine if they were fundamental and ironclad but, frankly, they're arbitrary, poorly supported, and often missing what's important. You're not arranging text on a page or trying to tell a whole cards story from the 10% visible in a tightly fanned hand.

I use to take $10 (which was reasonable amount back in 1979) if I lost it..., I went home. We played a version called 7's up, only the 7 cards up were used and the disk cards were shuffled back into the deck. ..., except one night (our hosts 30th birthday party) our host wanted to include a joker as a wild card. Night was going good..., 5 of us playing..., the bets kept going up and up till there was just me and the host left. He kept showing his cards to the guys behind him..., and kept upping the bet, to the point I \\\"HAD\\\" to stop him..., he had bet his entire fortnights wage, which was close enough to $400 (he was married with a new born baby) even threatening to bet me my car against his (I had a Valiant Charger, he had a custom Ford build). The thing was \\\"I KNEW\\\" it was impossible for me to loose and refused to take his bet. In the end I decided enough was enough and called him..., he super proudly and believing he had a winning hand laid down 4 aces..., the look soon turned to horror when I laid down 5 jacks..., the irony is I got the joker on the second group of cards. I had to give him back $20 so he could buy baby formula to feed his kid (no ATM's in those day's). He was forever greatful that I knocked back the car bet...., hopefully he learnt his lesson. 😊\",\"E quel momento del anno che succede!!!\",\"My hat is off to you\",\"Very acurate\",\"NICE EAIT\",\"This is a fantastic video, well done Simone!\",\"I thought poker was a card game for the members of the harem\",\"what was the first game played with these playing cards?\",\"@@neveryknow uno is like this at game night with all genders.\",\"I agree a lot.

Era un gioco bellissimo e molto avvincente, si poteva giocare in 3-4 o 5 giocatori, ognuno per proprio conto senza accoppiamenti. La sostanza del gioco era che si dovevano chiudere le otto carte pescando o dal tallone o dallo scarto del giocatore che precedeva. Con la possibilità di rinunciare a pescare e \\\"battere\\\" pagando 1, 2 o 3 punti. Gli altri giocatori pagavano tutte le carte non sistemate a combinazioni di tre, quattro o più carte. Se si chiudevano tutte le otto carte si aveva diritto a togliere -10 punti dal proprio punteggio mentre gli altri pagavano sempre le carte non \\\"sistemate\\\" come detto sopra. Il gioco finiva quando un solo giocatore rimaneva con un punteggio inferiore 71 punti. Il gioco finiva anche quando un giocatore sistemava tutte le otto carte secondo una scala reale o una combinazione di otto carte uguali (otto 2, otto 3, otto 4... etc.) Queste ultime 2 combinazioni si pagavano con il doppio o il triplo della posta. Vi assicuro che ci si divertiva tantissimo a prescindere dal valore della posta e sopratutto era un gioco che richiedeva la max concentrazione perchè poi c'erano diverse altre regole che impedivano e punivano ogni distrazione...

The standard deck of our cards has 36 cards: 6, 7, 8, 9, Banner (which basically functions as the 10), Under (which means subordinate and is equivalent to the Jack), Ober (which means something like lord and replaces the queen), König (the King) and Ass (yeah, that‘s how we call the ace😅).\",\"I began to play poker on discord and discovered a game full of mysticism, variance but strategy.

If fifty-two cards to a deck and fifty-two weeks to a year, there must be some way to make it work out to find the date, right? – Here’s how. You have to first remember this order of suits: Spade, Diamond, Club, Heart. Knowing this order will note each week of the month as Week-1, Week-2, Week-3, and Week-4. So, for January 1st, it would strictly be the Ace of Spades, and the same card will be used to note the top of the first week in the order of weeks following a second card that marks the day(not weekday) of that week. So by placing a four of any suit, you mark yourself on a picture frame that it is the “fourth day of the first week” of January being January 4th. This methodology works only by using up to the number 7 card. Because by following the order, on the 8th you will replace the initial week card to the Ace of Diamonds, and it represents the 8th of January by its sole self. You then use the cards 2-7 to mark the day of the days of week as they progress through. You have to note that when changing the Week card in following this order, the cards themselves to the number of that month will only represent the 1st, the 8th, the 15th, and the 22nd. The second card, being any suit 2-7, represents the numbered day within that week. When you get to the end of the week, you can only get to a maximum of the 28th. After that, respective of the same order reveals a pattern where you can use the Kings for the 29th, 30th, and 31st. – So, a Four of Hearts with a King of Diamonds means it would be the 30th of April. And then the following day becomes the Five of Spades, noting the first of May. There’s been a third card adding to the collective of two cards during this period. Another set of 1-7 cards used to represent the day of the week. Not much of this has been mentioned, but there’s speculation as to what day begins the day of the week: M-1, T-2, W-3, Th-4, F-5, Sa-6, Su-7. There’s nothing stopping you from setting apart a specific suit for noting this function from the aforementioned perspective. Perhaps you use a picture frame and stick the second card behind the Week Counter card, and use a Joker in front of the weekday card. This is what I found that works.\",\"Yep\\u002fyea\",\"I have always been taught that the game is to 120 as that is the total of all the points in the deck. and played 3 out of three to win.

Looking at regular playing cards (like poker cards), while some cards have the name on all 4 corners, a lot of the biggest brands (like Bicycle) have the name of the card only on the top-left and bottom-right. It seems to be generally accepted as a common practice to fan cards with the top-left corner visible. And the only peoples I've met that complained about it were left-handed, so maybe there is something about the majority of right-handed peoples finding it easier to fan that way while the majority of left-handed peoples finding it easier to fan the other way. As for my own experience, I'm right-handed, and I hold card with my left-hand so that I can play with my right hand. While with two hands I can fan both ways, if I try to fan only with my left hand (and I do one-handed fanning most of the time), it's much easier for me to fan to show the top-left corner.

For every second that passes this person is going through one new permutation. The other person, meanwhile, takes one step over 1 million years. Two steps, two million years, etc. This person does this until they've circumnavigated the entire planet. Once them get back to where they started, they then take one drop of water out of the ocean. One million more years, one more step, one more trip around the world, and they take a second drop of water out of the ocean. They do this until there is no water left in the ocean. Once it's dry, they then take a piece of paper and place it on the ground. One more step, one more pass around the world, and then they put one drop of water back in the ocean. This is done until it is full again. A second piece of paper. This process keeps happening until this stack of paper reaches the sun.... 3000 times. Once that last piece of paper has touched the sun, only then will the first person have finished shuffling that deck of cards and will have seen every permutation of cards.\",\"Cazzo tante\",\"​tg Fenham @@ZachXFire79\",\"Your work lives up to your name\",\"Thanks for the video nice job explaning the game 😂\",\"I almost idi man\",\"What an EDIT\",\"Daje bro la prossima metti solo quelli nuovi sennò ti esplode casa\",\"good video\",\"aaaaaaaaaaa bro stop aaaaaaa mamaamammama aaaaaaaaaaaaa brrrrrrro aaaa\",\"​@ThatchairinthecommentsOmg that chair in the comments!\",\"bro compare cartoons and live action movies💀\",\"@@AngelusNielson That's true, I have my fair share of plains cards...

Looking at regular playing cards (like poker cards), while some cards have the name on all 4 corners, a lot of the biggest brands (like Bicycle) have the name of the card only on the top-left and bottom-right. It seems to be generally accepted as a common practice to fan cards with the top-left corner visible. And the only peoples I've met that complained about it were left-handed, so maybe there is something about the majority of right-handed peoples finding it easier to fan that way while the majority of left-handed peoples finding it easier to fan the other way. As for my own experience, I'm right-handed, and I hold card with my left-hand so that I can play with my right hand. While with two hands I can fan both ways, if I try to fan only with my left hand (and I do one-handed fanning most of the time), it's much easier for me to fan to show the top-left corner. I can do it with one sweep of my big thumb, while I need multiple tries and\\u002for some helps from my other fingers to fan the other way.\",\"Ogni anno ho sempre più paura che jack sia sommerso da mazzi di carte Non oso pensare al prossimo anno\",\"im pretty sure its the episode when he is inside of gary, and he gets thirsty during the fall, so he drinks a soda\",\"Fun but modern idea.

Knowing when to use graphics and when to just leave it streamlined is a huge thing for card design. In my experience the most important information is: What kind of card is it When can i use it (instant vs sorcery) What and how much resources does it use What it actually does.

First, playing cards are based on dominoes (and dominoes are based on dice), after that they made money cards, Chinese Cards deck had 4 suits, coins, strings, 10k, and miriads(4th was miriads), they droped miridas when they created mahjong. Value in the corner of the card is appered just in XIX century, check your info more closely\",\"A few corrections and elaborations: 1. Japan didn't get playing cards from China, instead it was Portuguese missionaries and traders who brought cards with them. They were then declared illegal and only criminals would play with them. Hanafuda was actually created as a way to play cards without using what looks like actual playing cards. Nintendo started as a cardmaking company. 2. Italian cards, much like spanish cards, don't really have a queen, instead they have a cavalryman. The queens appear of course in italian tarot decks. 3. Tarot was actually created for card games too! The major arcana were originally the suit of triumphs (it. trionfi), which appropriately triumphs over the other four suits. From this word we get the english word \\\"trump\\\" and german \\\"Trumpf\\\". In france, the game of french tarot is the second most popular traditional card game. Tarot de Marseilles is still made with card play in mind under the name of \\\"tarocco piemontese\\\" in Italy. Tarocco Bolognese is still alive and well in Bologna. 4. The Swiss have their own set of suits also! The swiss suits are a variant of german suits, where leaves are replaced by shields and hearts by roses. These cards are usually called Jasskarte because they're predominantly used to play games of the jass family (like clobyosh or belote, though swiss jasses form a whole sub-family of their own), and to the point that games that are not jasses but are played with these cards are called jass too, e.g. Kaiserjass aka Kaiserspiel (which is a direct descendant of the oldest known european game, Karnöffel) 5. Rank and suit indices are actually a fairly recent addition! A lot of italian latin-suited (and even french-suited) regional decks, which generally are pretty old patterns, have no indices.\",\"A Royal Flush is a Straight Flush just the highest one available.

In fact, it allows a fine grain hierarchy on the power level, even when there are effects that manipulate those stats. For example, a monster with 2450 atk is stronger than a 2400 but weaker than a 2500. And even if an effect halves their atk, the monster has 1225 atk, wich keeps it stronger than the 1200 and weaker than the 1250. If there were only 2 digits, all three would have 12 atk, removing the power hierarchy on them. Also, there are archetypes that can take advantage of halving your life points. If you have 8000 life points, you can half them 12 times (keeping 1 LP). If you had only 2 digits, you could only half 6 times your 80 LP.\",\"@@gaminmations7697 it’s not better\",\"Mamma mia quanto vorrei avere anche solo un decimo di quel tappeto ahaha\",\"Tra 20 anni: home tour del mio nuovo castello di carte\",\"@@Typewriters875 glad to know I had an inpact on someone for once in YouTube comments\",\"AND I WANT MORE!\",\"Sempre io che ho in tutto 2 mazzi di carte: ok Jack scusa, hai vinto tu. 😂😂\",\"Exactly\",\"@@LibertyMonk The \\\"Art is Paramount\\\" in my opinion helps MtG get away with it. There are a handful of cards I don't know the name of in my deck but I know their art and the art of these cards is easier to see upside-down (as the opponent) so I tend to focus more on the art of the card and recognise it rather than trying to see the name. And besides that, the name isn't really important. The cost, power\\u002ftoughness and effect are easily more relevant than the name and those can be seen by fanning it displaying top right. In my country at least, nearly all playing card brands display information in all 4 corners. If you asked me to name every card in even my most played MtG deck off the top of my head I couldn't. I could survive with having the names blacked out for every card as I recognised their art, the combination of costs and effects. Obviously, when learning the alternate arts and new sets, names are important but in my opinion, art, cost and power\\u002ftoughness make all spells far more recognisable than name. This may differ from other peoples experiences and card games but that's why I think MtG gets away with it.\",\"I’m loving these videos!

There is also a read\\u002fwrite head that can move across the tape. There's other details that are too long (check Wikipedia), but it's basically that a Turing Machine only requires the head to follow a finite series of instructions (e.g. a program) to write and read. It would be trivially easy to chose a representation of 0 (blank) and 1 on a deck of cards (e.g. A-7 = 0, 8-K = 1) and then create a game with rules that mimic Turing Complete operations. The human player would operate as the tape head. Even Turing himself conceived of the original tape this way, with the head being someone literally following a rote set of instructions. @satibel is more or less correct, and even includes memory registers for a display. The limitation of 52 cards isn't actually an issue, because \\\"this is a Turing Machine barring memory limitations\\\" is always a caveat for IRL Turing Machines, as the mathematical one can have infinite memory.

As for the Magic Card, sure there's some minor merit to your Rule 1, but it's *very* minor. As you say later, the cards in your hand are indeed the cards you put into your deck, so you don't need the mana cost visible all the time while you have things tightly fanned. People have object permanence and minor memory capacities. They can see the mana cost (and other info) and then remember it for most cards even when it's obscured. Furthermore, The mana cost being on the left side under the name of Tarmogoyf now causes two problems. First is that it's obscuring the picture, and the picture is the most important thing because - again - people remember the info on their own cards. They just need to recognize which card they have, and that mana cost there is obscuring the image if there are similar 1-F green cards. Two, the beauty of Magic cards is that everything is placed in its own relevant space, so you can find the information you want about the card by looking at a distinct section of it. name, image, mana cost, creature type, power\\u002ftoughness, effects (and sometimes flavor text). They're partitioned out so everything is clear and the info for one section doesn't distract from info in another section. This puts the mana cost and the name in the same spot, and makes the mana cost unclear because of the curved behavior. This works for something that costs some colorless mana and a single colored mana, but what if it cost 3 forests? 5 forests? Now the mana cost design has to curve around and make the spacing uneven and make counting harder. So your format is either going to suck for some cards, or you're going to only use this format for cards with few colored mana, making a split standard which makes it that much worse to look at cards and evaluate their information at a glance. Because now you need to look in two different locations with two different formats for mana cost. Which is why that Gangar card is such cancer. The image now covers the whole damn thing, being distracting in general and making reading any of the text a nightmare. Well defined borders and information is important. And no, it doesn't have to be \\\"most to least important, top to bottom\\\" like some kind of passage in a book. The important thing is that relevant information is visible, and in its own space so you can instantly fixate on whatever information is most Sorry but, while this video was nicely produced, you're speaking like these design rules are gospel. And that'd be fine if they were fundamental and ironclad but, frankly, they're arbitrary, poorly supported, and often missing what's important. You're not arranging text on a page or trying to tell a whole cards story from the 10% visible in a tightly fanned hand. You want each card, individually, to have its information clear, organized, identifiable, and recognizable. Absolute location doesn't matter as much as being distinct. People's memory takes care of the rest. And because it's so bad, I have to say it a third time. That Gangar card was cancer and you ought to be ashamed for holding that up as some kind of implication that players \\\"just don't know what's good for them.\\\"\",\"😢😢\",\"È bellissimo questo video\",\"Nessuno: Jack tra 10 anni: \\\"bene raga, dopo 2 ore di video vi ho fatto vedere tutta la collezione\\\"\",\"Yeah but according to UNO YOU CANT FUCJING STACK +2 CARDS ONTOP OF EACHOTHER NOR CAN YOU DO THAT WITH +4 CARDS\",\"@@LOL10076 It is true\",\"20:46 - Jack, \\\"Monkey king\\\" sono le carte della leggenda dello scimmiotto giapponese da cui venne tratto il manga di Dragonball e tanti altri film e anime che abbiamo visto molti di noi!\",\"Come ogni anno spacchi❤️\",\"Single handedly written, directed, and yes… EDITED by yours truly, Legendary Jay.

Notably, a deck of cards does not have rules to change that deck by, so it is not Turing Complete. Magic the Gathering is a set of rules combined with playing cards which can act as the counters, that's why it's Turing Complete, because through its cards + rules you can have infinite loops i.e. infinite counters\",\"Nothing to do with Texas hold-em\",\"Fr😅\",\"Except in the real rules, that doesn't work.

Sure, maybe the design, but for a very long time there was no jokers in most card games. There's a family of card games using the tarot cards, the tarok games. They are very old games of european origin. They have special rules for The Fool card, so you could say that it was the first joker. But for the rest of the games? Karnoffel didn't use them, Piquet doesn't, Skat doesn't, Whist doesn't. Euchre was one of the first modern games to use them, being designated as the second-highest and highest cards of the trump suit. If anything, the major arcana inspired the trump suits in modern games! Before Whist (that's around 17th century I believe?), there was no trumps in most card games. Again, only Tarok had it. And it was the major arcana that was trump! One evidence of that being the case is the card game Piquet, created during the lifetime (maybe a little more) of Jeanne d'Arc, 15th century. No trumps there, all suits equal. And a bit of personal opinion: Piquet is a difficult game, hard to do the hand estimations there.

The design of magic cards is so well made for speed-reading a card and giving you all the information you need in a glance. Magic is like the street fighter of card games, and the fact that the design of the cards has not changed much is a sign of how well designed are they. Not perfect, but clearly effective. Considering you are playing, that you know the cards in your deck, and that you are thinking about the gameplay rather than the visuals: Name being on top, cost and power being in the same side means you can hold 7 cards in your hand have all the relevant information to know what cards you have just with 10% of the actual cards visible. By revealing 10 % more of the card, you may recognize the art, and you only need to fully see the card if you need to read the text, which is often keyworded for speed. A full read of the card is only needed once when you draw the card, where its all visible anyway, or as a quick reminder while playing. I've always held cards in my hand in a way this is obvious. You just need to fan the cards the other way. As a designer, when you see a flaw on the top dogs, you need to ask yourself whether or not you are the one making a mistake, and analyse why that mistake is there, rather than thinking \\\"its old, they didnt know any better, and players dont want it to change because they are dumb\\\".

There are a handful of cards I don't know the name of in my deck but I know their art and the art of these cards is easier to see upside-down (as the opponent) so I tend to focus more on the art of the card and recognise it rather than trying to see the name. And besides that, the name isn't really important. The cost, power\\u002ftoughness and effect are easily more relevant than the name and those can be seen by fanning it displaying top right. In my country at least, nearly all playing card brands display information in all 4 corners. If you asked me to name every card in even my most played MtG deck off the top of my head I couldn't. I could survive with having the names blacked out for every card as I recognised their art, the combination of costs and effects. Obviously, when learning the alternate arts and new sets, names are important but in my opinion, art, cost and power\\u002ftoughness make all spells far more recognisable than name.

However, I have to ask... have you tried fanning the cards in the other direction?\",\"It is a feature most people won't need or use and can potentially be conceived as non-essential clutter, why it shouldn't be a golden rule. But I do agree, that it at the very least should be a consideration during the design phase. If used it should only be placed in non-intrusive place so it doesn't shift focus. This rules out the corner of a card as an option, but something like faded text integrated to the bottom of a picture or perhaps at the bottom of the card itself are more valid options. The latter is what MTG use now, apparently called \\\"collection number\\\". I'm not a fan of it because it is ugly - but it is fine, I guess. Not something I have any use for. There can be some gains. Like in games where the number is integral to the game mechanics (e.g. Bang! where a number\\u002fsuit can blow you up or save you from being shot), or games where additional rules often is needed (makes for faster rulebook index). Looking up a number is definitely faster than names\\u002fwords. It doesn't matter in simple games (e.g. Settlers of Catan, where all cards are numbered) and where a little extra clutter won't make much difference. OT: Getting increasingly annoyed of all the different languages of games. You can relatively easily get hold of the German, French or Dutch version of games like Oriflamme here in the EU, but you'll often need to double or triple the cost to import a proper English\\u002finternational version. Games are already expensive enough to get hold on here in Denmark... I guess some of it is down to copyrights laws, etc. Mass production of English versions would be nice :) @@gaijinco\",\"1:10 Huh.

It is a variation of the much more famous game Scopa, and it is played with the 40 card italian deck (you can also play with the french standard deck using only the first seven cards per suit and the figure cards). It is called Ruspo. To learn Ruspo you first have to learn Scopa, wich is played as follows (the game can be played in 4 or in 2, but I will teach how to play for two players): HOW TO PLAY SCOPA The game starts by dealing three cards to the players and putting four cards on the table. The card values are as follows: The first seven cards of each suit are worth face values, the Jack is worth 8, the Horse (in Italy it's called Horse not Knight) or Queen is worth 9, and the King is worth 10. In turns, starting with the player that DIDN'T deal the cards, the players play cards and take cards from the table of equal value to the card they played. For example, the first player plays a king, in the table there is 2, 7, 3, 4; so the player that played the king will take the 3, the 7 and the king they played, wich =10, and will put the card in front of them face down (if instead of 2, 7, 3, 4 there was 2, 7, king, 3 the player that played the king would have directly taken the king). It is now the other player's turn. If a player doesn't have anything to take, they simply play a card on the table. This continues until the players don't have any more cards in their hands, so the dealer will deal three more cards to the players. If a player in a given moment plays a card and takes every card on the table (for example: 2 and 4 on the table and the player plays 6) they say \\\"scopa\\\" and marks it with a face up card on their deck of cards they took. On the last round, wich is when there are no more cards to deal and the players have their last three cards, when all players don't have any more cards to play the cards on the table get taken by the last person that took cards from the table. The game is over, and now it's time to assing the points. You gain a point by: - each scopa you did - If you have Re Bello (King of coins or King of diamonds) - If you have Settebello (Seven of coins or seven of diamonds) - If you have more cards than the opponent, if it's a tie no one gains this point - If you have more sevens than the opponent, if they tie you count the six, and if they also are tied this point isn't counted - If you have more coins or diamonds that the opponent, if they tie this point isn't counted The first to arrive to 21 points wins, if both players arrive at 21, they continue playing until one wins more points at the end of a match. HOW TO PLAY RUSPO (IN MY OPINION THE BETTER VERSION) The game is played like scopa, and the points at the end of the match are counted in the same way, but there are this changes: If on the first four cards on the table an Ace shows up, you put another card on the table, put the Ace in the deck and shuffle it. Instead of taking by playing a card face up, you take by playing a card face down, so this allows the players to cheat (for example, there is a 7 on the table, the player cheats by playing a 6 face down and takes the 7). Of course, the players can also take with the correct card, but they still have to play it face down. The player that didn't play can doubt what the other player did before them: if they doubt the cards that have been taken on the turn before are revealed, if the player that played the cards played correctly, they keep the cards and mark a scopa, if they cheated, they put the cards they took on that turn on the table and the opponent marks a scopa. The opponent has to doubt the other player's action before he plays a card, if it was the last card, before they see the new cards. The Aces are special cards: the player can play an Ace face down and say \\\"ruspo\\\" then take all the cards on the table, even if there aren't any; taking all the cards with an Ace does not mark a scopa. Clearly, the player can do a ruspo with every card, not just an Ace, as long as the opponent doesn't doubt; if they doubt, the mechanism explained before is applied. If the player can't or doesn't want to take they can also choose to play a card on the table like normal. The point at the end are counted the same way as Scopa, the first to arrive to 41 points wins.\",\"Gojo, Saitama, and Goku's power no holding back combined cannot compare.\",\"@@LinoPlayz-p8d holy goldfish attention span\",\"sei forte jack \\u003c3\",\"If zachtronics made a solitare game, knowing nothing else about it except that its a zachtronics game removes any of the judgement that you are anticipating from me.

The seven books of the Apocrypha\\u002fDeuterocanon were not recognised by all Catholics prior to the Reformation, and hence were not part of the canon. (Hence the name Deuterocanon - literally, second canon - adopted by the RC Church.) The RC Church unilaterally made these books canonical after the Reformation at the Council of Trent. Several doctrines and dogmas of the RC Church, such as purgatory, rely heavily on these books which Protestants do not believe Divinely inspired. Protestants do not deprecate these books: they have a high regard for them. So highly are they regarded, that in English Bibles it was common for them to be printed in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments, right through to the 19th century. Personally I think they should still be printed there, although I can understand the reasoning of those who take the opposite view. Two final points: first, Martin Luther did not determine the books of the Protestant Bible, there were a multitude of Reformers who reached a consensus; and second, your opinion that somehow the Protestant Bibles use corrupted texts is erroneous. The King James Bible, the most famous of them, is arguably the first \\\"modern\\\" Bible in the western world, based on extensive scholarship, providing a synthesis of all original manuscripts available at that time. From a scholarly point of view, although the beauty of its language remains unequalled, it has since been superceded by new translations (based on academic advances and older manuscripts that have become available over the last 400 years, which were unknown to the original translators).\",\"Another fantastic video marred only by Simone's categorically incorrect pronunciation of Balatro.\",\"jack anch'io vorrei avere una collezione come la tua e la sto iniziando però ho solo otto mazzi .

I was taught this game by my Sicilian grandfather as a very young child. We played it all the time when I was a young girl. Since then, he’s passed, and I no longer have anyone to ask in my family that recalls how to play! So now I’m a mother of 4 kids and I’ve always wanted to share this with them. Nothing I searched in google came up with any results. I’m sooo excited happy to have come across this video, because I was searching by the wrong word! My grandfather used to say “Gotcha!”- or however you’d spell the word that sounds like “doo-weetie”, which is clearly “to vitti”. (You can understand how a little kid might misunderstand the pronunciation of a word, especially a language she’s not used to.) And google translate for “Gotcha” is “preso”, which I knew for sure it wasn’t called that! So when I watched this video, and heard you pronounce it the way you did, I got a good laugh at my child version of myself misunderstanding what my grandfather EVERY TIME he said “ti vitti” for “doo-weetie”, and was THRILLED to FINALLY find the correct spelling and the game I’ve been searching for for years!

How come you know all this?\",\"One thing most cards are missing (which is weird because regular playing cards have that) is an index. In most games you still hold your cards fanned in your hand. You just can't see ANY info. Sometimes the background is different, giving you some information (like a type or something in MtG). But that's it. Hearthstone gets away with it, because they assist with highlighted borders. A card that can be played is green. A card that targets a minion can't be played with no minions on the field, even if the cost is within your current budget. A card that has a special effect gets a yellow border. Often this border appears when an effect occurs like \\\"look, your opponent played a type-X minion. This card has a bonus that just activated\\\". That's a luxury that non-virtual games don't have. IF I have a card in my hand that is strong against the undead, I want to see it at one glance. If a card has a combo effect, I want to see it at one glance, so I can plan my move). Not many games even have this kind of info as an icon (hearthstone does in a limited form with icons for special effects, death cry etc - on the bottom of the card). In many games you need to read the text to get an idea what this card is about. If you translate the text to klingon, a water type with a kombo effect is indistinguishable from a fire type with a permanent buff during certain conditions). That makes it very hard for new players to enter the game and makes strategizing a long process. The more cards you have, the worse it gets.\",\"Bro turned this short into dragon balls 🐉🤣 oh and the cleanest word is uno out or when the guy sips\",\"Bro I thought u were died u haven't posted in like 2 months the last time I saw u\",\"Wow what a funny and original comment.

As mentioned in the video the face cards in the standard deck weren’t documented as having universal names until around the advent of the Paris Pattern. I didn’t actually choose their names (as much as I’d love to 😏) rather went off of the oldest sources I could find which named them. Tarocchi is a different animal entirely and besides the naming of the 5th suit any representation of who they might have been based on is not at all standardized. I’ll be uploading Tarot next month.

The design of magic cards is so well made for speed-reading a card and giving you all the information you need in a glance. Magic is like the street fighter of card games, and the fact that the design of the cards has not changed much is a sign of how well designed are they. Not perfect, but clearly effective. Considering you are playing, that you know the cards in your deck, and that you are thinking about the gameplay rather than the visuals: Name being on top, cost and power being in the same side means you can hold 7 cards in your hand have all the relevant information to know what cards you have just with 10% of the actual cards visible. By revealing 10 % more of the card, you may recognize the art, and you only need to fully see the card if you need to read the text, which is often keyworded for speed. A full read of the card is only needed once when you draw the card, where its all visible anyway, or as a quick reminder while playing. I've always held cards in my hand in a way this is obvious. You just need to fan the cards the other way. As a designer, when you see a flaw on the top dogs, you need to ask yourself whether or not you are the one making a mistake, and analyse why that mistake is there, rather than thinking \\\"its old, they didnt know any better, and players dont want it to change because they are dumb\\\". That said, the design of yugi-ho text is horrendous for new players.\",\"And I will do the videographing for you\",\"#2 is very poor design. Just have the information in a consistent location. Putting it in an importance “hierarchy” leads to a good portion of the card not mattering and the art on your example looks abysmal.\",\"@@awesomeoptimus9093Yeah pretty average uno game if you ask me\",\"Does anyone know the name of the song?\",\"@@syaredzaashrafi1101 never heard of it before but I'll watch it.

In a tcg, you only carry your decks and some dice, not the rules.\",\"Yea I agree\",\"You said that art doesn't contribute to playability, but I don't think that's correct. Art is much easier to recognize than names, it's much easier to realize what cards are in your hand, on the table, or find something looking through the deck by looking at the art than by reading the names. Art is important for the same reason as all the other rules, they make the cards more readable.\",\"@@schwarzerritter5724 open a fan with your right hand and see how the cards are pushed\",\"This made me sub.❤\",\"Mi potresti regalare le blackflower Mi servirebbe un mazzo per iniziare.\",\"I'm such a fucking nerd I recognized Diaconis' name from his paper Tracing the Dovetail Shuffle to its Lair from when I wanted to program an accurate shuffle function\",\"Io ho la coppia di mazzi rarissimi (100 pezzi totali) \\\"animal\\\" e \\\"bird\\\" gold di Natalia Silva.

Most people can't visualize a 2\\u002f25 chance, but they can understand \\\"if you draw an ace.\\\" It also helps to control the spread of options. For example, in dice-based games, there is no limit to your ability to roll well or roll poorly, which means one person _could_ never roll under 15 on their raw D20 while the next person never rolls over 5. But a limited number and selection of playing cards means you can only ever get four kings, four 2s, etc. This makes them useful for the indie TTRPG designers I know who want to ensure nobody has an accidental advantage or disadvantage in play.

Piacentine and Napoletane are 2 out of the 11 Italian decks with the swords\\u002fwands\\u002fcoins\\u002fcups suits, the others being Siciliane, Romagnole, Sarde, Bresciane, Bergamasche, Trentine, Triestine, Trevisane and Bolognesi, all of which are 40-card decks, except the Bresciane which are a 52-card deck. Additionally, there are 4 french-suited decks, all with 40 cards, namely Milanesi, Toscane, Genovesi and Piemontesi. Finally, there's also a German-suited 40 card deck, the Salisburghesi, totaling 16 visually and sometimes mechanically different decks across all Italy. But that's not all! There's a completely unique deck made for playing a game called cucco (or cucù, or stu) that still survives in the area surrounding Montorio al Vomano within the Abruzzo region. That game can still be played with a more common 40-card deck, but it's rare to see it played with that specialized deck, especially outside of the aforementioned area.\",\"‼️🦾🧠soooooooooooooooooool cool 😎\",\"is it just me or the noses look like penises?\",\"That has to be the hardest uno fight I’ve ever seen.

The copy I show in the video is marked 1971 and has 112 cards in it. In my book, Timeless Toys, I write: \\\"While Bob Tezak served as the company figurehead, Ed Akeman ran day-to-day business. International Games started in Akeman’s Lockport, Illinois apartment, and because the game was not available in many stores outside of Cincinnati, Ed took write-in orders directly from Uno fans and shipped games from his apartment-turned-warehouse. Store orders trickled in as the game started to take off. “I would pass cases of Uno out the first floor window of my apartment, directly to the UPS man,” Akeman remembered. “That was how we began.” Part of the purchase from the Robbins family included inventory, and after they sold out of the remaining original “pea-soup” green Uno games, International Games (or IGI as they were known) made several changes....\\\"\",\"33 sec ago\",\"One thing most cards are missing (which is weird because regular playing cards have that) is an index. In most games you still hold your cards fanned in your hand. You just can't see ANY info. Sometimes the background is different, giving you some information (like a type or something in MtG). But that's it. Hearthstone gets away with it, because they assist with highlighted borders. A card that can be played is green. A card that targets a minion can't be played with no minions on the field, even if the cost is within your current budget. A card that has a special effect gets a yellow border. Often this border appears when an effect occurs like \\\"look, your opponent played a type-X minion. This card has a bonus that just activated\\\". That's a luxury that non-virtual games don't have. IF I have a card in my hand that is strong against the undead, I want to see it at one glance. If a card has a combo effect, I want to see it at one glance, so I can plan my move). Not many games even have this kind of info as an icon (hearthstone does in a limited form with icons for special effects, death cry etc - on the bottom of the card). In many games you need to read the text to get an idea what this card is about. If you translate the text to klingon, a water type with a kombo effect is indistinguishable from a fire type with a permanent buff during certain conditions). That makes it very hard for new players to enter the game and makes strategizing a long process. The more cards you have, the worse it gets.\",\"Ok champ\",\"aye your born to be a content creator my guy\",\"I'm still waiting for the next patch to balance the poker meta\",\"BRO PLEASE DO MORE\",\"😅😂😂😂\",\"good video\",\"you just introduced me into so many more days and weeks of solitaire.....thank you for your service\",\"Video fra 10 anni \\\"Ho comprato una casa solo per le carte\\\"\",\"Grande Jack ti seguo da quando avevi neanche 100 iscritti.

Also as you have flops, turn and river stages it enriches the strategy as each player tries to calculate whether they have the best hand early and want to raise aggressively to reduce the odds of an opponent making a really strong hand later etc. The scope of strategising and mind games is deeper and richer than other versions.\",\"Haahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahah\",\"Fr😂😂\",\"Ogni anno una goduria per gli occhi\",\"Exactamente\",\"I learned to count playing poker with my family.

I think it comes from playing video games as much as I have, but it was also because I specifically fan my cards the way I do due to Magic Card layouts. The power and toughness is very inconveniently under my right hand thumb, but knowing the cost rules out cards before their power and toughness is relevant anyway, so I can move my thumb to see that or the card effect. Whichever I need to see right now. Memorizing my cards also lets me only consider them on if I can play them or not, which means my method of fanning which is just \\\"reverse how you do it\\\" and is just as easy and viable as your method. Not sure why you do it that way unless you're playing Poker, honestly. But anyway, that's not a flaw on the cards. It's a very minor mistake in your method of holding them. In the case of Magic the cost is simply on the same side as the power and toughness to allow you to expose both at the same time. This is particularly useful is OG Magic where you had many monsters that only had a power and toughness and no effect, so you could stack them to cover everything except the card's colors (in the cost), and power and toughness on the same side. I'm not making this comment to say \\\"you're wrong\\\" because you're not! Just like with your method of fanning your hand works best for Poker and some other games but not for Magic, it's an element of the game that's designed for. There is no \\\"correct location\\\" for a cost. There is only a \\\"best location for your game\\\" for a cost assuming you have a cost. So yeah, you're right in your case, but I wanted to make this comment to help anyone new to game design understand that like all other examples and rules of design the location of your card's cost is up to interpretation within the confines of your game. Also try fanning your Magic cards out with your thumb instead.\",\"Fr😂😂\",\"I mean thay can’t keep things straight thare😭🙏\",\"no, i don't think i will\",\"can you pls make a remake of this vid\",\"Ah e terribili\",\"😍🔥\",\"Jack sei un grande ogni anno fai questo video e ogni anno viene più bello con più mazzi.

Inoltre, se non fosse possibile aggiungere carte a burraco 'chiuso', come si farebbe a calare una scala reale? Ancora, è sempre obbligatorio posizionare le carte di traverso alla base del burraco, cioè con questa azione poi lo si chiude definitivamente?

However you can award a “black hand” bonus for points games. Just make sure to announce that before play to avoid disagreements. I’ve played a 40 point bonus (like the first bonus in the “married couple” variation). This gives you a nice advantage but keeps it fair.

You dont need two different spheres of different colours to define attack and defense values, information like tribe or the colour of a card does not need to be communicated as a large sigil in the center of the card. Knowing when to use graphics and when to just leave it streamlined is a huge thing for card design. In my experience the most important information is: What kind of card is it When can i use it (instant vs sorcery) What and how much resources does it use What it actually does. And that order is important as it decreses thinking time.

Despite the fact that Italy became an independent country only in 1861, an Italian national identity has been existing since the Middle Ages, even if it wasn't as strong as it has been since the 19th century. Dante Alighieri (who lived in the second half of the 13th century) was the first one who tried to invent an Italian language that could create a bond between the various people that lived in the Italian peninsula. Many other Italian men have tried to encourage their countrymen to join together in one state throughout the centuries, long before 1861. Also, the name \\\"Italy\\\" (\\\"Italia\\\" in Latin) was given to the peninsula by the ancient Romans centuries before the birth of Christ. Admittedly, the inhabitants of Italy at the time were called Italics, not Italians, but the peninsula had the same name as today.

Hold'em has a great combination between face up cards and hole cards (personally i think PLO's combination is even better) There's also Chris Moneymaker's legendary win on tv in 2003, a rag to riches story that made the news. What did he play? NLHE. Just a few years before that, the GOAT poker movie Rounders 1998 came out. Most of the games in the movie was Stud and near the start:\\\"NLHE is the cadillac of poker\\\" \\\"Some people, pros even, won't play no limit hold'em, they can't handle the swings\\\" Now it's no longer the poker cadillac, everyone plays it and stud is almost obsolete. Even games of Limit Hold'em in a casino like in the Johnny Chan scene are super rare now\",\"Nicely done informative content\",\"On that first rule, I fan with my thumb, not with my fingers. I think it comes from playing video games as much as I have, but it was also because I specifically fan my cards the way I do due to Magic Card layouts. The power and toughness is very inconveniently under my right hand thumb, but knowing the cost rules out cards before their power and toughness is relevant anyway, so I can move my thumb to see that or the card effect. Whichever I need to see right now. Memorizing my cards also lets me only consider them on if I can play them or not, which means my method of fanning which is just \\\"reverse how you do it\\\" and is just as easy and viable as your method. Not sure why you do it that way unless you're playing Poker, honestly. But anyway, that's not a flaw on the cards. It's a very minor mistake in your method of holding them. In the case of Magic the cost is simply on the same side as the power and toughness to allow you to expose both at the same time. This is particularly useful is OG Magic where you had many monsters that only had a power and toughness and no effect, so you could stack them to cover everything except the card's colors (in the cost), and power and toughness on the same side. I'm not making this comment to say \\\"you're wrong\\\" because you're not! Just like with your method of fanning your hand works best for Poker and some other games but not for Magic, it's an element of the game that's designed for. There is no \\\"correct location\\\" for a cost. There is only a \\\"best location for your game\\\" for a cost assuming you have a cost. So yeah, you're right in your case, but I wanted to make this comment to help anyone new to game design understand that like all other examples and rules of design the location of your card's cost is up to interpretation within the confines of your game. Also try fanning your Magic cards out with your thumb instead.\",\"Grande Jack\",\"Whats the music\",\"io ne ho 10 di mazzi più uno doppio. 😂 comunque grande jack\",\"This is daily uno mental gymnastic😂\",\"There is no history to record because people just play games and make up rules as they go along.

It's played with 52 card deck, 4 cards are placed on the table and each player is dealt 4 cards. A game is played by picking up cards as same as in Scopa. The difference is that you don't get extra points for sweeping the table but Jacks have a power of doing that. So regardless of the nubmer of cards on the table and their number, a Jack can take them all. Jacks, Queens and Kings do not have a number value. Points are given as follows: 1) One point for each club collected 2) One point for more cards collected 3) One point for a two of clubs (\\\"little two\\\") 4) One point for a ten of diamonds (\\\"big ten\\\")\",\"Independent works are what true art is.\",\"This was fascinating.

But I do agree, that it at the very least should be a consideration during the design phase. If used it should only be placed in non-intrusive place so it doesn't shift focus. This rules out the corner of a card as an option, but something like faded text integrated to the bottom of a picture or perhaps at the bottom of the card itself are more valid options. The latter is what MTG use now, apparently called \\\"collection number\\\". I'm not a fan of it because it is ugly - but it is fine, I guess. Not something I have any use for. There can be some gains. Like in games where the number is integral to the game mechanics (e.g. Bang! where a number\\u002fsuit can blow you up or save you from being shot), or games where additional rules often is needed (makes for faster rulebook index). Looking up a number is definitely faster than names\\u002fwords. It doesn't matter in simple games (e.g. Settlers of Catan, where all cards are numbered) and where a little extra clutter won't make much difference. OT: Getting increasingly annoyed of all the different languages of games. You can relatively easily get hold of the German, French or Dutch version of games like Oriflamme here in the EU, but you'll often need to double or triple the cost to import a proper English\\u002finternational version. Games are already expensive enough to get hold on here in Denmark...

My point is that while the cards aren't perfect, the location of the mana value isn't so bad it could be considered a design flaw. Sure, some information might be hidden in some case because some players might hold their hand in a way that hides the information BUT all they have to do, if they want that information, is slightly adjust their fingers. That's hardly a flaw. Also, I am a game designer with 15 years of experience and a degree in development. I did freelance graphic design on the side of that for 5 years.

In fact, it allows a fine grain hierarchy on the power level, even when there are effects that manipulate those stats. For example, a monster with 2450 atk is stronger than a 2400 but weaker than a 2500. And even if an effect halves their atk, the monster has 1225 atk, wich keeps it stronger than the 1200 and weaker than the 1250. If there were only 2 digits, all three would have 12 atk, removing the power hierarchy on them. Also, there are archetypes that can take advantage of halving your life points. If you have 8000 life points, you can half them 12 times (keeping 1 LP). If you had only 2 digits, you could only half 6 times your 80 LP.\",\"Bellissimo video, sta diventando l'enciclopedia delle carte!\",\"This already got like 100 million views on tiktok not just dropped\",\"This feels like a conversation yuno and Asta would have 😂\",\"The joker is used as a spare if you loose a card you write on the joker the symbol and color of the lost card and play with it\",\"Jack sei un grande\",\"im here to BUST\",\"prossima serie: ho costruito un castello con mazzi di carte 😂😂\",\"She reads the script like it’s a corporate mandated sexual harassment course\",\"Every Friday night for me\",\"Yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not someone I yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was also summoning a draw for or not someone I yeah it's a good thing you can challenge that because if the guy who was play a job for was going to pick a color the other guy was going to you have then he would have to draw all those cards that you were going to\",\"BRO İTS SO GOOD\",\"That's not the point you goofballs😂😂 he's just saying that 10 people in general will make you feel that way.\",\"3:16 The Full Tilt chip sounds really hit me in the nostalgia\",\"This is the kind of top-quality stuff YouTube was made for\",\"🫥 i hope they put your ass to work lil man\",\"Yes, it would probably be better that Demon Slayer.

People are being cheated every single day wether they are playing live or online. It doesn't matter if you are playing a tournament or a cash game you are so likely to be cheated. From the smallest micro stakes online to the highest stakes at your local casino, you can't escape it. Collusion, marked cards, RTA (real time assistance) are just some of the ways people cheat. Even if you are not being cheated the casual recreational player has very little chance of winning in the long run. The amount of strategy information on the game is overwhelming. There are an endless supply of books on the game. Dozens of training sites. Software online to study your game and track your opponents. Poker Coaches and study groups. Apps on your phone. It's insane really. The game has been broken down and picked apart into tiny little pieces and the amount of study and playing time needed to be competitive and merely break even is just not worth it. My point is that there are other games to play besides NLH. Dozens. Look into the mixed game tournament at the WSOP. Everyone has heard of 7 Card Stud and 5 Card Draw. Those are great games and there are dozens of variations of those games. Badugi, Omaha Hi\\u002fLo 8 or better, Razz, 2-7 Triple Draw, A-5 Triple Draw, 7 Card Stud Hi\\u002fLo 8 or Better, Limit Holdem, No-Limit 2-7 Single Draw, Pot Limit Omaha (PLO)...The list goes on.
