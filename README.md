# Generative Narrative Design

## NLP and semantic analysis of scraped data to output narrative minimum units (the narremes).
The narremes are the basic output of nouns (as subjects, characters, concepts, objects...), adjectives (emotional, sentimental values), and verbs (relationships, actions...). By putting these together we obtained a name that is tagged as marginal (could be a description of an environment) or central (protagonist actions), depending on the role in the narrative. The narrative itself gets out following the connections and relationships of different narremes between each other, which can happen sequentially following a chain of events and relationships. A minimal cluster of a closed-off narrative is called a storylet, and in the case of this study is used as the minimum narrative unit that when connected with others, the linking will provide an interactive narrative to follow.

## Application of the analysis
The linking and chaining of narremes and storylets are used to let people know about immaterial cultural heritage (ICH). A single storylet can be used to generate creative co-sessions with museums, designers, and researchers to create narrative environments, or as a way to promote heritage research and inputs, applying the concepts found in the research as promotional material for the general public or to find people connected to the heritage to deepen the connection. 

Otherwise, the linking and chaining as a whole can be outputted in a videogame/interactive fiction format using the narremes as principal plot points/puzzles or as interactive documentaries (i-docs), to engage the people in more intimate ways.
